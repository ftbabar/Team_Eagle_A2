            <div class="hannah">
               <h4>Hannah Smith</h4>
               <p>
                  Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently lives
                  on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high school in
                  1999, then, after studying film in college, she moved to New
                  Zealand for five years, where she opened a retail store. After
                  moving back to Australia in 2007, Hannah ran an online
                  wholesale and retail business for twelve years before deciding
                  to pivot her career and is now studying IT at RMIT University.
                  Currently, she is working as a digital designer and eCommerce
                  manager for an online retail business. She enjoys spending
                  weekends with her family and paddle-boarding on the lake after
                  winning a SUP board in a -fifty words or less- competition.
                  Hannah believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT
                  when researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                  to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                  look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                  realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but rapidly
                  changing the way we live and work in all industries. Initially
                  being drawn to design because of her creative background, she
                  started to investigate the user experience and user
                  interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite her. After researching
                  the impact of digital monitoring technologies on the
                  Australian populace, she also became very engrossed with the
                  development and ethics of modern technologies. Hannah has
                  previous IT experience including relational skills, small
                  business, strategic planning, as well as design competence.
                  She is also familiar with the Office Suite, some of the Adobe
                  design platforms and online communication and sharing tools
                  like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

               <h4>Fatima Babar</h4>
               <p>
                  Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                  Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in Pakistan
                  with her family and grandparents. Being a dual nationality
                  holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu fluently and has
                  also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has recently completed
                  Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to complete a Bachelor of
                  Arts degree (Majoring in Digital Experience and Interaction
                  design) within the next 3 years. Fatima's interest in IT
                  developed with the efforts of her father, a software
                  developer, who was always convincing her to follow his lead
                  into becoming a software developer too. However, it wasn't
                  until her father started a remote job that Fatima started to
                  take interest in this field. Due to her love for art and
                  design, she has now decided to become a digital designer and
                  is studying hard to achieve her goal. Fatima has no prior
                  experience in the IT field except for learning the basics of
                  HTML, CSS, and graphic design essential skills from LinkedIn
                  Learning. Her dream is to become a successful digital designer
                  and travel the world. In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking
                  and decorating cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always
                  looking forward to the summer holidays season in which she
                  enjoys travelling with family and cousins.

            <div class="nathan">
               <h4>Nathan Smith</h4>
               <p>
                  Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                  35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being Portra
                  400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and learning
                  something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a kid when he
                  got his first family computer. He was always on it, mostly
                  playing games at that age. It grew from there when Nathan
                  became more interested in what his dad was doing as he was an
                  IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan enrolled in Tafe to
                  become a network engineer so he could follow in his dad's
                  footsteps. He has now been working in IT for the last ten
                  years across four different jobs and has spent the last nine
                  years on two separate support desks. This has given him
                  relevant experience in IT and good exposure to different
                  technologies. Nathan's current job has given him more
                  experience in software development, which is where he sees his
                  career going. Nathan brings many skills to the team. Some of
                  his skills and qualification (apart from being a GitHub
                  master!) are:

            <div class="sarahc">
               <h4>Sarah Carney</h4>
               <p>
                  Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has dual
                  citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone who
                  strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees in
                  Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                  collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The
                  concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                  somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy
                  to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had never
                  deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the industry
                  in general. She had spent a lot of her career working in law
                  and overseas and on returning to Australia, she took the
                  opportunity to try out a new industry - telecommunications.
                  Over time, she moved into a project role, and that was her
                  first real exposure to what is possible with IT. She learned
                  about EPICs, features, user stories, and wireframes, an entire
                  world she had never known existed. Sarah was hooked.
                  Naturally, when a friend reached out and asked if she would be
                  interested in joining Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and
                  there, she has found her home. Sarah has worked in management
                  roles for several years, across a few different industries. As
                  a result, she has multiple skills and experiences which
                  include:

                  <h4>Sarah Taulava (Brinckman)</h4>
                  <p>
                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.

               <h3>Online Test Outcomes</h3>
               <p>
                  Our group is well-balanced when it comes to the members'
                  personality traits. When working in a team, it is always
                  beneficial to have people that vary in the way they understand
                  and do things. One thing that we all have in common is the way
                  we cope with our emotions and make decisions. According to the
                  Myers Brigg results, all members rely on feeling rather than
                  thinking and think for the well-fare of others. Our main
                  question is: "who does this help?". This is evident within our
                  individual project ideas from assignment 1. When it comes to
                  our learning styles, the results also vary. Some members learn
                  better by reading and writing while others by listening,
                  speaking, or trying.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This information is definitely very helpful for the group. To
                  have effective communication with a positive outcome, one must
                  first understand who they are communicating with, and what
                  might be the best way to convey a message to them. By viewing
                  each other's test results, we can better make use of the
                  skills and traits each member brings with them. We will know
                  who may be the best one for a particular task and how to help
                  or give feedback to another member when needed. Not only does
                  this help other members, but every individual can also realise
                  their own weaknesses and work to overcome them in ways which
                  suit them the best. The result: Hopefully a very successful
                  and happy team!

              aiming to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology degree,
              there will be different outcomes and career trajectories. The
              collective ideal jobs, whilst having some similar skills and
              responsibilities, are all different.<br>

               Technical Lead was chosen for Hannah’s Burning Glass Match
               because her role would involve leading a large team of technical
               experts and was the closest fit. Big Data Engineer was chosen for
               Nathan as big data is usually associated with machine learning
               algorithms and this was the closest fit. ‘Full Stack Engineer’
               did not appropriately capture Nathan’s particular interest in
               machine learning and artificial intelligence. While these are
               the best fit out of the Titles in the data, in reality, the
               roles chosen by Hannah or Nathan do not appear in these lists.
               This may indicate an even smaller number of hires in these
               roles and they are both roles that would likely appear on this
               list rather than a list from another profession.
             </p>

             <p>
               For this exercise roles were chosen that were more generally
               in the direction of interest, so the specificity of these titles
               is perhaps not the best data-set for considering the team’s
               prospects. As seen in Figure 1, all positions are outside of the
               top 25 Titles with Hannah the highest-ranked at 31 and Sarah C at
               77 followed by Fatima, Sarah B, and Nathan. The more generalised
               ‘Top Occupations’ list shows a more positive result and is perhaps
               the more relevant when deciding a way forward at this early stage
               in the course. Here, if a job was felt to relate to multiple
               occupations, both were included. This was to give an idea of the
               range of options/directions but the strongest match was graphed
               with a solid black line and the minor occupation a dotted line,
               See figure 2.1. But again, there was no exact match for
               Nathan’s interest in machine learning so the closest related
               occupations were used.

           <h3> Skills Analysis </h3>
               <p>
                 While this data provides useful insight into what
                 may be a fruitful addition to a curriculum vitae it
                 should be viewed more as a general guide to consider
                 which skills an individual has overall and where they
                 might be missing some opportunities. It would be
                 useful for job seekers to incorporate some of these
                 terms/skills, particularly generic skills, which they
                 may possess but may not have thought to actively include
                 in previous job applications.
               </p>

               <p>
                 Some highly ranked skills are more complimentary for many
                 jobs but would rarely be the primary skill to determine
                 eligibility, like communication skills. Some terms may
                 be interchangeable to recruiters like ‘self-motivation’
                 and ‘self-starter’ so it is difficult to ensure complete
                 coverage.  It is also worth pointing out that some of the
                 skills likely to determine job eligibility are not directly
                 matched those of the Burning Glass data, nor would some
                 implied skills be explicitly listed to feed into the Burning
                 Glass text analysis algorithms. For example, Hannah’s job
                 makes no mention of specific technologies, but would it be
                 possible to lead an Innovative Engineering and Design team
                 without a solid technical understanding? Perhaps, but
                 unlikely. However, Burning Glass’ data has proven quite
                 accurate/useful, and inclusive overall.

               <p>
                 Generic skills identified were matched with their closest terms
                 in the Burning Glass Generic Dataset (Burning Glass Technologies
                 2018d), however, some terms were only found in either the IT
                 Skills dataset or the Data_Software & Programming dataset
                 (Burning Glass Technologies 2018d) which were more generic–
                 they are denoted by an asterisk (*). Each list has been colour
                 coded by quintile so comparing across datasets for a general

                <li> Problem-solving is the 2nd ranked Generic skill that
                  was not included in the skillset, however, it would certainly
                  be a part of all of these positions but was just not

            <h3> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of
                  your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h3>

              <p> Hannah is open to the development of career goals over time.
                  Making sure to broaden the focus of skillsets acquired will
                  boost hireablility. Fluidity in thinking will maintain a
                  relevant outlook. Though the initial aim was Design Director,
                  the data shows the broader term of Technical Lead to be a
                  more available position. Keeping an eye on the requirements
                  for new job roles within IT will direct study paths and
                  ensure the current practice is forefront in learning.
                  Networking amongst like-minded peers will open channels to
                  job roles. Some of the profile tools used to develop these
                  connections and showcase skills are Slack groups, Linked In,
                  Twitter, and Blogs. Hannah is following mentor careers and
                  panels in the hope of emulating them. </p>

              <p>Nathan’s passionate interest in machine learning and
                 particularly artificial intelligence (AI) has not been
                 dampened by this analysis. Demand for machine learning in a
                 variety of industries is growing rapidly and, considering that
                 these figures are from 2018, it would not be surprising to
                 see demand for these skills already higher and growing
                 substantially over the short to medium-term. Many of the
                 skills which build the foundation for machine learning
                 projects are already in high demand, so working towards an
                 ultimate career in AI by gaining expertise in big data, data
                 engineering, programming with git and python would be a
                 practical choice with many opportunities along the way.
              </p>

              <p>Fatima’s opinion of her ideal job has not changed. She realises
                 that some of the skill set required for her ideal job as not
                 very much in demand. This is a major reason why Fatima chose to
                complete 12 of RMIT’s subjects (from the Bachelor of IT degree)
                alongside her actual goal of completing a Bachelor of Arts in
                UX/UI design. She plans to choose these 12 subjects carefully,
                keeping in mind the most in-demand skills in the IT industry.
                Fatima expects that with the completion of these subjects, she
                will have gained a variety of good IT and Generic skills related
                 to software development that will be of help if, and when she
                 decides to change careers.
              </p>

              <p> Sarah B has concluded that it would be sensible to broaden
                the direction of an ideal job to focus more on software
                development and web development rather than specifically mobile
                application development. Remote opportunities are more readily
                available in programming/software and including these skills
                would increase the likelihood of better roles in the future.
                This is also a skillset well utilised in the international
                development space.  It would still appropriate to pursue an
                internship or job opportunity with a company like Ionata
                Digital, per her learning plan, as they work on a broader range
                of products with an application development portion too. This
                data makes it clear that communication skills are important to
                employers across most jobs and it would be advantageous to
                actively develop these further.
              </p>

              <p>Sarah C can see that there are limited opportunities in her
                chosen career path, but this is not surprising as not all
                organisations will have a CIO. If they do have a CIO, there is
                usually only one of those roles available within an organisation
                which aligns with why most of the skillsets for the role are
                also not as common. As the job descriptions for the CIO role do
                not consistently list specific technical skills, this will
                likely be the most challenging area for Sarah to focus on. The
                majority of the skills listed are generic skills, which also
                make differentiation in the marketplace hard. This is a
                long-term goal and will require consistent focus, as well as
                continuing to revisit job descriptions to make sure her
                development plan remains relevant and targeted.

               <h3>Jess Dodson - Customer Engineer (Microsoft)</h3>

               <p></p>
               <h4>The job</h4>
               <p>
                  Jess is in her second year of working for Microsoft as a
                  Customer Engineer. Having previously worked as a System
                  Administrator, Jess has expertise in the area of security,
                  which is what she now predominantly specialises in. The main
                  focus of her current role is to support her customers in their
                  use, understanding and application of their Microsoft
                  technology investments. For Jess, this means the majority of
                  her time is spent with customers teaching, sharing,
                  demonstrating and troubleshooting.
               </p>

               <p>
                  With a background in government and higher education, these
                  tend to be the industries and customers she supports in her
                  work for Microsoft. Within these industries she observed that
                  "IT is seen as a cost sink" and that IT teams are always
                  trying to find ways of doing more with less and operating with
                  very lean teams. Throughout COVID Jess has seen a huge shift
                  in focus in these industries towards security. With the
                  increase in remote working and BYOD trends, identity,
                  authentication and end to end security conversations are her
                  core focus.
               </p>
               <h4>The activities</h4>
               <p>
                  A typical day for a Customer Engineer depends on whether they
                  are scheduled to be with a customer or not. On a customer
                  facing day, typical activities include triaging email, seeing
                  what has come in overnight, preparing for the customer
                  presentation and checking any demo environments. It isn't
                  unusual for Jess to spend 6 - 10 hours on any given day in
                  Teams voice or video chats with customers - whether that is
                  teaching them something new, doing a demo, running an
                  assessment on existing deployments and infrastructure or
                  helping lead them through building something new in a lab or
                  their own environment. On average, Jess estimates she spends
                  75% - 80% of her time working directly with customers. She
                  considers herself to be a technical translator. To be
                  successful in her role, she needs to find ways of explaining
                  sometimes complex technical jargon and concepts in simple,
                  easy to consume ways. Her audiences can be anyone from the
                  helpdesk team to the CEO, which requires an aptitude for
                  understanding the audience and delivering a message they can
                  relate to or understand.
                  <br />
                  On days without customers, Jess focuses her time on technical
                  training and upskilling. Keeping current with the technology
                  she is delivering is critical. She is the face of Microsoft
                  into that customer and is often expected to know a lot about a
                  broad range of subjects. Jess actively sets aside time to make
                  sure she is up to date on product changes, proposed features,
                  as well as understanding what competitors are doing with their
                  products.
                  <br />
                  Jess regularly contributes to podcasts, interviews,
                  conferences and other speaking engagements. She is a sought
                  after presenter and dedicates additional time to building her
                  content for these sessions.
               </p>
               <p>A typical week for Jess could look something like this:</p>

               <img
                  src="images/working-week.png"
                  alt="Image of calendar"
                  width="50%"
               />

               <p>Jess faces two main challenges in her role:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Interaction. Currently Jess is required to deliver all her
                     work remotely. Hosting deeply technical calls with up to 25
                     people at a time, who are also all working remotely,
                     creates a real challenge in building a rapport, creating
                     personal engagement and driving interaction. For sessions
                     that can span multiple days, this is a real challenge when
                     trying to help customers get the most out of their
                     experience, at the same time as gauging whether the
                     material is pitched at the right level and people are all
                     following what is happening.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Articulating the why. The second challenge Jess faces is
                     articulating why customers should do what it is she is
                     recommending they do. With a lot of the assessments that
                     Jess does, there are usually recommendations or changes
                     that need to be made, some of which will have a financial
                     impact for an organisation. Jess must find ways of
                     delivering her reports or findings in a compelling manner
                     that enables the customer to take those recommendations
                     forward and sell them to their own internal stakeholders.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                  Jess's most valuable technical skills at the moment relate to
                  security. She has skills across Azure IaaS which she leverages
                  on a weekly basis, but it is security tools and Azure Sentinel
                  and conversations about Security Incident and Event Management
                  (SIEM) specifically that are in the highest demand.
                  <br />
                  When taking on the Customer Engineer role, Jess was surprised
                  to find that Executive Presence was a skill she needed on an
                  almost daily basis. Often, she isn't talking to just other
                  technical professionals, but to business owners, investors and
                  C-level executives. This requires her to be compelling and
                  able to demonstrate great presence.
               </p>
               <h4>The interactions</h4>
               <p>
                  When working with customers, the following are the kinds of
                  roles Jess finds herself interacting with:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Security analysts</li>
                  <li>System admins</li>
                  <li>Infrastructure engineers</li>
                  <li>Network engineers</li>
                  <li>CIO</li>
                  <li>CISO</li>
                  <li>CEO</li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  These interactions can vary across information gathering,
                  delivering technical training, providing a demonstration, or
                  presenting the outcome of an assessment. Given the broad range
                  of work that Jess delivers, it is unsurprising that she
                  interacts with such a broad range of roles whilst working with
                  customers.
                  <br />
                  At Microsoft, Jess has a second set of internal stakeholders
                  that she interacts with each week. These include:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     Account Managers - as they "own" the customer relationships
                     and can share key information about the customer itself
                     such as internal structures, who the main stakeholders are,
                     and any current work being done with the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Cloud Solution Architects - who might also be working with
                     the same customer and delivering POC engagements or other
                     related technical activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Account Technology Strategists - work with customers to
                     support the development of their ongoing digital strategy,
                     including demonstrating new technology as it is released.
                     Jess needs to know what is being shared or shown to the
                     customer, so her presentations are aligned.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Account Executive - the Account Executive owns the sales
                     strategy for a particular customer and Jess will work with
                     them to understand what is currently planned or can share
                     any insights she gains from the work she does for them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Her manager - Jess has a manager who supports a group of
                     Customer Engineers and is there to assist Jess with any
                     challenges she is facing, help her build and execute on her
                     personal development plan and provide coaching to help her
                     growth.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  The final, and perhaps most significant group of people that
                  Jess interacts with internally are other Customer Engineers.
                  Through Teams channels and distribution lists she and her
                  fellow Customer Engineers form a strong support network. As a
                  group they are able to share ideas, updates on product
                  changes, but perhaps most importantly, they provide a valuable
                  source of information to each other. No one person could
                  possibly know the depth and breadth of all products developed
                  by Microsoft, but the team of engineers are able to support
                  each other and find the answers quickly to almost any customer
                  challenge. Jess has actively cultivated her network to help
                  her be more able to support her customers when they have
                  questions she doesn't have an immediate answer to.
               </p>
               <h4>In closing</h4>
               <p>
                  When asked about an example of the work she does that best
                  captures the essence of the IT industry, Jess shared an
                  example of a Government customer she has been working with
                  over a long period of time. The customer has multitudes of
                  Microsoft products that were previously unused or
                  under-utilised. Often in her role, interactions are one off,
                  or single days. With this customer, Jess has been back four
                  times now. What has happened over this time is that she has
                  been able to assist them with increasing and building their
                  confidence with using their products. She has seen incredible
                  growth and learning from them as they have moved towards
                  greater technical maturity as an organisation. Jess feels that
                  IT is all about learning. The rate of change and innovation is
                  so high in this industry, you have to keep up or get left
                  behind, "If you don't like learning, you are going to be in
                  the wrong job".

               <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
               <h4>What does it do?</h4>

               <p>
                  Cybersecurity is the process of protecting and guarding the
                  digital world against cybercrimes (Shaukat et al. 2020). Some
                  of the main categories of cybersecurity include network
                  security, application security, information security, and
                  operational security. Cybersecurity is not only crucial for
                  companies and businesses of great scale, but also for
                  individual users of the web and other digital services. With
                  the passage of time, people are relying significantly on
                  technologies and computers for a myriad of tasks. Mobile
                  banking is becoming increasingly popular, which leaves more
                  people at risk of having their financial data hacked (Oreku &
                  Mtenzi 2016). Information and communication technologies are
                  used in almost every system including financial and emergency
                  services (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016). In the present times,
                  cyberspace has become an essential factor for all fields and
                  areas and the reliance on the internet has led to increased
                  risks of malicious threats (Shaukat et al. 2020).
               </p>
               <p>
                  Today, there are multiple practices through which the security
                  of a digital product or service can be ensured. Some of the
                  techniques used to prevent cyber attacks include game theory,
                  rate control, heuristics, signature-based intrusion detection,
                  autonomous systems, and end-user security controls (Zeadally
                  et al. 2020). When it comes to the implementation of these
                  practices, awareness plays a crucial role. Without an
                  understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and how to
                  deal with cyberattacks, the consequences are bound to be more
                  damaging. Currently, encryption and identity checks are the
                  most commonly used tactics for cybersecurity. Anti-virus
                  software and firewalls are used to prevent cyberattacks.
                  Businesses have prioritised cybersecurity challenges (Kaja,
                  Shaout & Ma 2019). In larger companies, where the stored
                  information may be critical and require a high level of
                  protection, cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers
                  are hired to identify and secure any surfacing vulnerability
                  within the system. However, as Skopik, Settanni and Fiedler
                  (2016, p. 154) state, 'the Internet threat landscape is
                  fundamentally changing'. The intention and objectives behind
                  cybercrimes have converted and cyberattacks are now carried
                  out in highly complex and targeted approaches that deceive the
                  average security measures (Skopik, Settanni & Fiedler 2016).
                  New technologies are rapidly being produced, with little
                  research and production of the security required to defend
                  these technologies. This leaves undetected gateways for
                  cybercriminals to enter through, leading to destructive
                  consequences for the users of the services and in some cases,
                  to the service owners and providers also (Kaja, Shaout & Ma
                  2019). As within the physical world, the digital world also
                  demands security for its users and the information stored
                  within it. Cybersecurity defence systems must be also using
                  state-of-art technologies to tackle the latest types of
                  cyberattacks.
               </p>

                  Data and networks are significantly becoming more and more
                  sophisticated. This is an area where artificial intelligence
                  (AI) and machine learning (ML) can work better than humans to
                  provide security in the cyberspace. The use of AI and ML has
                  resulted in breakthroughs in numerous problems and can
                  certainly help in solving current and future cybersecurity
                  issues (Kaja, Shaout & Ma 2019). AI is capable of analysing
                  and inspecting large amounts of data and has proven to be an
                  effective technique for identifying false information
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). It can also 'adapt to the changing
                  nature of Internet traffic' (Zeadally et al. 2020, p. 23827)
                  This is something that would otherwise consume a lot of time.
                  Machine Learning technologies are a field of Artificial
                  Intelligence (Shaukat et al. 2020) and are currently being
                  used in cybersecurity to automate attack detections and
                  enhance their performance over time (Zeadally et al. 2020). ML
                  techniques have a crucial part in battling cyberattacks
                  including intrusion detection system, malware detection,
                  phishing detection, spam detection, and fraud detection
                  (Shaukat et al. 2020). However, some ethical issues and
                  concerns come with the involvement of AI in cybersecurity
                  (Timmers 2019). Also, the limitation that AI relies on
                  learning data that is manually processed and inspected opens
                  the possibility of inaccurate data with regard to
                  cybersecurity (Kim & Park 2020). Another issue is that
                  although ML techniques can efficiently maintain cybersecurity
                  by protecting against attacks, they are also vulnerable to
                  cyberattacks themselves and choosing the most appropriate ML
                  method so far is challenging (Shaukat et al. 2020). Also, for
                  the detection of DoS attacks, real-time detection and decision
                  making is necessary. It is not yet explored how AI can be used
                  for this purpose (Zeadally et al. 2020). Cybersecurity
                  researchers are continuing to explore the use of AI in
                  cybersecurity (Zeadally et al. 2020). It is likely that within
                  the next few years, a significant amount of cybersecurity
                  procedures will be performed with the help of AI and ML.
               </p>
               <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
               <p>
                  With the involvement of AI in cybersecurity, the process of
                  detecting a security problem and fixing it will require
                  significantly less time. The approach will focus more on
                  protecting the software or data. This is because prevention is
                  nearly impossible considering the fact that hackers would be
                  using the same technologies for performing cyberattacks
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). Companies will no longer need to hire
                  ethical hackers as this job would be carried out by AI. As
                  Braganza et al. (2020, p. 1) declare, 'Artificial intelligence
                  (AI) is challenging the foundations of businesses and changing
                  the ways people work globally'. Although AI will replace
                  humans in cybersecurity process where mechanical and
                  analytical intelligence is required, its potential is limited
                  when it comes to areas that require intuitive and empathetic
                  intelligence (Braganza et al. 2020). Consequently, the
                  involvement of AI will not affect jobs but rather the nature
                  of the work (Braganza et al. 2020). Professionals would still
                  need to monitor the AI and ML technologies to ensure their
                  efficiency and protection. Although this development will
                  eventually replace some current cybersecurity jobs and
                  technologies, it will bring along new job opportunities such
                  as AI and ML experts who are familiar with handling the
                  AI-driven cybersecurity systems. Some of the current
                  technologies may be used in conjunction with the AI and ML
                  techniques to provide effective security systems.

                  With real-time detection and protection, the risks of users
                  becoming victims of ransomware will also reduce. Individual
                  home PC users would be safer from cyberattacks with the help
                  of smarter, AI-driven intrusion detection systems. People will
                  not have to do too much to ensure that their information is
                  protected in the cyberspace as the system will be doing it for
                  them. The chances of human error and slips will be
                  significantly reduced. However, users would still need to go
                  through particular procedures to ensure their security systems
                  are working properly. People who use social media or any other
                  app or service that may store any sort of personal information
                  can feel more secure and assured that their data is safe from
                  hackers. A drawback that may be faced is that people might
                  gain a 'false sense of security' and trust the AI system and
                  its decisions without actually knowing how the decision has
                  been reached (Timmers 2019). It is unrealistic to say that one
                  will be 100% secure, or that cybersecurity will be
                  unbreakable. Regardless, as use of the internet increases
                  within society, the ethical security culture would eventually
                  turn into a norm which will assist in tackling cybercrimes
                  (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016).

               <h3>Machine Learning</h3>

               <h4>What does it do?</h4>
               <p>
                 In 1956, machine learning pioneer Arthur Samuel succeeded at
                 programming a computer to teach itself to surpass his ability
                 at playing checkers. (McCarthy, n.d.) He coined the term
                 ‘machine learning’ and defined it as a “field of study that
                 gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
                 programmed”.  (Ng, 2020).
               </p>

               <p>
                 Computers process large quantities of data accurately and
                 quickly. If tasks can be reduced to their fundamental data and
                 logical arguments, then computers can perform these tasks much
                 better than any human. The outcome of performing these tasks
                 can form another data-point, enabling the computer to ‘learn’
                 to perform the task better next time. A computer can also find
                 relationships in the variables not detectable by humans to
                 ‘learn’ the likely results of a new set of variables. The
                 reality of machine learning though is “…nothing comes out [of
                 a computer] which has not been put in…”(Samuel, 1960).
               </p>

               <p>There are three main types of machine learning algorithms in
                 use (Padala et al., 2019):</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Supervised learning algorithms rely on defined data labels.
                  The machine can look for patterns so that, given a new input,
                  it could predict the likely output.

                  Example: The programmer might input large quantities of
                  labeled images of handwritten lettering, the computer would
                  process all these images and ‘learn’ to read some previously
                  unseen handwriting. Computers do now outperform humans in
                  handwriting analysis. (Esposito, 2017).
                </li>

                <li> Unsupervised learning algorithms look for patterns in data
                   where there are no labels. (Ng, 2020, Esposito, 2017) Given
                   a large dataset, the computer may start to identify
                   particular outcomes that correlate with particular inputs.
                   Here the algorithm identifies meaningful limits based on
                   probability factors around clustered data-points.

                   Example: This has been used in looking at the etiology of
                   certain diseases, for example. The algorithm is fed large
                   amounts of health data and may be able to meaningfully group
                   them by particular traits to give clues to factors affecting
                   the disease state. (Ng, 2020)
                 </li>
                 <li> The third type of machine learning approach is
                   reinforcement learning. Here the algorithm is provided with
                   feedback based on its activity. This model draws on operant
                   conditioning in behavioural psychology. (Dayan, 2002)

                   Example: Arthur Samuel’s checkers playing computer would
                   play countless games against itself, recording when chosen
                   moves resulted in a rewarding outcome to refine its playing
                   strategy.
                 </li>

                 <h5>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h5>

                 <p> Roughly 90 percent of the world’s total data is thought to
                   have been generated in the past 2 years alone. (Bulao, 2020)
                   For computers, this is data like any other, patterns can be
                   found if the computing power allows. The increasing size and
                   variety of data sets available allow for more complex,
                   multi-layer pattern identification known as deep neural
                   networks. With further increasing computing power and
                   different approaches even more can be understood drawing
                   from this data; Quantum computing is that next frontier.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   Quantum mechanics is a separate branch of physics dealing
                   with phenomena at an atomic level. (Adams, 2019) Quantum
                   computers can process information much more quickly and
                   handle calculations that overwhelm even the most powerful
                   super-computer currently. Gideon Lichfield (2020) describes
                   the difference between a traditional bit and a quantum bit
                   (qubit) as follows:
                 </p>

                 <blockquote cite="(Lichfield, 2020)">
                   “If information were color, then a classical bit could be
                   either black or white. A qubit when it’s in superposition
                   could be any color on the spectrum, and could also vary in
                   brightness.” (Lichfield, 2020)
                 </blockquote>

                 <p> This opens possibilities for breakthroughs in anything
                   that can be represented in data, which is theoretically
                   everything.
                </p>

                <h5>What can be done now? </h5>
                <p>Deep neural networks are unlocking understanding previously
                  out of reach with more complex algorithms utilising the huge
                  quantities of data now available and substantial developments
                  in computing power.
                </p>

                <p>While there is significant commercial interest in quantum
                  computing the delicate nature of qubits and rapid decoherence
                  when in superposition is currently proving challenging.
                  Already D-Wave’s quantum computers are being deployed in
                  companies such as Volkswagen to learn to streamline processes,
                  though this is not a pure quantum computer (Kahn, 2020).
                  In 2019, Google claimed to solve a problem that would have
                  taken Summit  10 000 years. This, however, is disputed by IBM
                  (Lichfield, 2020). There is a race to develop a more stable
                  and powerful quantum computer, but each player has a different
                  end goal in mind.
                </p>

                <h5> What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next
                  3 years)? </h5>
                <p>IBM has promised a 1000-qubit quantum computer by 2023 with
                  a ‘stepping stone’ machine of 127-qubits this year.
                  (Cho, 2020) Google has a plan towards a million-qubit quantum
                  computer in the next 10 years. (Cho, 2020) Some estimate that
                  it would take a 20 million qubit computer to crack 2048-bit
                  encryption and that may be 10-20 years away.
                  (Bushwick, 2019) With each increase in speed and stability,
                  more insight into data is gained and the possibilities grow.
                </p>
                 <h5> What technological or other developments make this
                   possible? </h5>
                <p> Finding ways to stabilise superposition and the incredibly
                  environmentally sensitive qubits will allow the building of
                  bigger and better quantum computers.
                </p>
                 <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                <h5>What is the potential impact of this development?</h5>

                <p>
                  With deep learning and the sheer volume of data generated
                  every day, there is an opportunity to understand the world,
                  how it works, and human behaviour better than ever before.
                  However, with rapidly improving technology comes significant
                  privacy and ethical issues and changes here are not able to
                  keep pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Already machine learning facial recognition algorithms are
                  being used for racial profiling in the control of China’s
                  minority Uighur population, for example, (Mozur, 2019) and
                  have obvious international security implications. With the
                  rapid advancement of these technologies and the slow pace of
                  government legislation, potential issues are wide open. Even
                  news, search, and Facebook feed algorithms can dramatically
                  shape people’s world view, limiting exposure to the real
                  breadth of news/media. Most of these algorithms that shape
                  world views are trade secrets, society can only guess at how
                  it is being manipulated.
                </p>

                <h5>What is likely to change? </h5>
                <p>
                  Machine Learning is possibly the most significant disruptive
                  technology of this century – coupled with quantum computing,
                  it will likely change the way the how we understand the
                  Universe and humanity’s place in it as well as how people
                  interact in all spheres.  These changes, however, are not
                  only from intended advancements. The improvements in quantum
                  machine learning also directly threaten public-key
                  cryptography, underpinning much of the internet and modern
                  commerce. Researchers are looking forward to the quantum-led
                  collapse of 2048-bit encryption,  already exploring other
                  approaches to keep data safe. (Bushwick, 2019)
                </p>

                <h5>Which people will be most affected and how?</h5>
                <p>
                  If public-key cryptography is cracked without a suitable
                  replacement, the world’s data would be left exposed. It would
                   not just be those who shop online or use social media as
                   even the relatively ‘off-grid’ individuals likely have
                   housing titles, licenses, tax records, medical records. No
                   person in a connected society would be unaffected.
                </p>

                <h5>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current
                  jobs or technologies? </h5>

                <p>
                  Most manufacturing robots are already driven by Machine
                  Learning. Chatbots will reduce customer service roles/tech
                  support roles, couriers are likely to be replaced by
                  autonomous vehicles, market analysts, and even financial
                  advisors. There are elements of most jobs that will be
                  affected. On the other side of this though is an explosion
                  in machine learning roles, implementing these technologies
                  in businesses and homes around the world.
                </p>


               <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
               <h5>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h5>
               <p>
                 Machine learning is pervasive in 2021. Most people are
                 influenced by machine learning algorithms daily or likely even
                 hundreds of times in any given day. Google searches,
                 personalised social media feeds, news feeds, Netflix
                 recommendations, automated vehicles, chatterbots, dynamic
                 pricing, targeted marketing, new medications indicated by an
                 algorithm; the list is long and getting longer by the day.
               </p>

               <h5>What will be different for you? </h5>
               <p>
                 Particularly topical in the time of COVID, is whether some of
                 the deep learning models can help to alleviate future global
                 disaster. Epidemiological models can point to potential
                 pandemic outbreak risks (Sun, 2020), models can analyse
                 bushfire behaviour, or better find patterns in cyclone
                 behaviour. Similarly, deep learning models and quantum machine
                 learning could help unlock possibilities for addressing climate
                 change and other questions of global significance. The
                 challenge will be noticing how the individual is affected. It
                 will be unclear what has influenced a world view, a purchasing
                decision, a new medicine a doctor prescribes yet all of these
                  things will be subject to the influence of machine learning.
                  On a smaller scale, perhaps this century automated vehicles
                  may become mainstream, most homes will interact with a
                  chatterbot regularly, billboards will scan your face to
                  target their advertising, diseases may be cured.
                </p>

                <h5>

            <h5>How might this affect members of your family or your
            friends?</h5>
            <p>
              It is a frightening thought that children of today will grow up
              consuming most of their news from online sources curated through
              machine learning algorithms. One can never know the people they
              might have grown to be without this influence.
