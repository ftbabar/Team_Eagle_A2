                     Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently
                     lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high
                     school in 1999, then, after studying film in college, she
                     moved to New Zealand for five years, where she opened a
                     retail store. After moving back to Australia in 2007,
                     Hannah ran an online wholesale and retail business for
                     twelve years before deciding to pivot her career and is now
                     studying IT at RMIT University. Currently, she is working
                     as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for an online
                     retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with her
                     family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
                     board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah
                     believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when
                     researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                     to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                     look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                     realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but
                     rapidly changing the way we live and work in all
                     industries. Initially being drawn to design because of her
                     creative background, she started to investigate the user
                     experience and user interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite
                     her. After researching the impact of digital monitoring
                     technologies on the Australian populace, she also became
                     very engrossed with the development and ethics of modern
                     technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience including
                     relational skills, small business, strategic planning, as
                     well as design competence. She is also familiar with the
                     Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and online
                     communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
                     Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

                     Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                     Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in
                     Pakistan with her family and grandparents. Being a dual
                     nationality holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu
                     fluently and has also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has
                     recently completed Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to
                     complete a Bachelor of Arts degree (Majoring in Digital
                     Experience and Interaction design) within the next 3 years.
                     Fatima's interest in IT developed with the efforts of her
                     father, a software developer, who was always convincing her
                     to follow his lead into becoming a software developer too.
                     However, it wasn't until her father started a remote job
                     that Fatima started to take interest in this field. Due to
                     her love for art and design, she has now decided to become
                     a digital designer and is studying hard to achieve her
                     goal. Fatima has no prior experience in the IT field except
                     for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design
                     essential skills from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to
                     become a successful digital designer and travel the world.
                     In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking and decorating
                     cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always looking forward
                     to the summer holidays season in which she enjoys
                     travelling with family and cousins.

                     Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                     35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being
                     Portra 400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and
                     learning something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a
                     kid when he got his first family computer. He was always on
                     it, mostly playing games at that age. It grew from there
                     when Nathan became more interested in what his dad was
                     doing as he was an IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan
                     enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so he could
                     follow in his dad's footsteps. He has now been working in
                     IT for the last ten years across four different jobs and
                     has spent the last nine years on two separate support
                     desks. This has given him relevant experience in IT and
                     good exposure to different technologies. Nathan's current
                     job has given him more experience in software development,
                     which is where he sees his career going. Nathan brings many
                     skills to the team. Some of his skills and qualifications
                     (apart from being a GitHub master!) are:

                  <p>
                     Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has
                     dual citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone
                     who strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees
                     in Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                     collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art".
                     The concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                     somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some
                     joy to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had
                     never deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the
                     industry in general. She had spent a lot of her career
                     working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia,
                     she took the opportunity to try out a new industry -
                     telecommunications. Over time, she moved into a project
                     role, and that was her first real exposure to what is
                     possible with IT. She learned about EPICs, features, user
                     stories, and wireframes, an entire world she had never
                     known existed. Sarah was hooked. Naturally, when a friend
                     reached out and asked if she would be interested in joining
                     Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and there, she has found
                     her home. Sarah has worked in management roles for several
                     years, across a few different industries. As a result, she
                     has multiple skills and experiences which include:

                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.

               <p>
                  Team Eagle worked very well together for Assignment 2. Every
                  member was active and contributed well throughout the
                  assignment. Tasks were divided evenly, and members were always
                  ready to voluntarily help others when needed. Everyone
                  appreciated each other’s efforts. In terms of delivery of
                  work, all members ensured their tasks were completed on time
                  and hence, the team managed to submit work that they were
                  satisfied with. Observing our work in assignment 2, we now
                  have a better understanding of each members capabilities and
                  strengths which have been considered when dividing our tasks
                  for assignment 3. Although the team faced no challenges in
                  communication, there were some problems due to our overall
                  lack of experience with MS Teams and GitHub. Learning from our
                  work in assignment 2, the group has made some changes in the
                  way we use MS Teams. To avoid confusion, a new channel was
                  created for A3 communication purposes. A folder was created
                  for all meeting agenda/minutes files. This will allow members
                  to easily locate them when working on the tools section. The
                  team will follow a uniform format when noting down meeting
                  agendas and minutes. We will be also creating new folders to
                  categorise all our files as we go along. This was something we
                  did later on in assignment 2. Managing and keeping our
                  branches up to date with each other was a major problem that
                  we faced throughout assignment 2. In order to avoid wasting
                  time in merging our previous branches, we have deleted all our
                  individual branches and created new ones from the master
                  branch. Each member will make sure to pull in all changes from
                  the master branch to their personal branches whenever they
                  plan on making some changes to the HTML or CSS.

                  A major part of work in the IT field consists of constant
                  learning and hence all members of the team plan to complete
                  micro courses and university level subjects/degrees as a part
                  of their career plans. This is normally expected within the IT
                  field as new technologies are constantly being introduced
                  which change the way we work.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Both Hannah and Fatima plan on working in the design field,
                  but the skills required for their ideal jobs and career plans
                  are very different. This is mainly because of the experience
                  both members have. While one is working towards a senior
                  digital designer role, the other is already a digital designer
                  and hopes to become a Research design director. However, there
                  is still some similarity in their career plans as both aim to
                  work as a UX/UI designer to gain the experience and skills
                  required for their desired roles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  On the other hand, although Sarah Carney’s and Hannah’s ideal
                  jobs may sound totally different, there is similarity in the
                  generic and IT skills required for both these roles. Some the
                  common skills include:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Leadership</li>
                  <li>Team building</li>
                  <li>Risk management</li>
                  <li>Strategic planning</li>
                  <li>Relationship management</li>
                  <li>Agile development</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  Despite the similarities of generic/IT skills the two members
                  have very different career plans to achieve their goals (as
                  mentioned above). Of course, this is due to the differing
                  nature of their ideal jobs.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The skills required for Sarah Brinckman’s ideal job (Mobile
                  developer) have similarities with most of the other members’
                  job skills. There are also similarities between Sarah
                  Brinckman and Fatima’s career plans apart from their planned
                  studies. While Fatima hopes to Major in Design with elective
                  subjects from Information Technology, Sarah Brinckman plans to
                  do the opposite with the main focus on a Bachelor of
                  Information Technology consisting of a minor in Internet
                  design. Alongside their studies, both aim to work some entry
                  level jobs in their respective areas to gain experience and
                  enhance their portfolios. After this they will begin gaining
                  the years of experience required for their ideal jobs through
                  different job/roles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Nathan, Sarah Brinckman, and Sarah Carney all are working
                  towards the Bachelor of Information technology provided by
                  RMIT university. However, while Sarah Brinckman will be
                  minoring in Internet Design, Nathan chooses to complete his
                  degree with a minor in Economics. Both have chosen their minor
                  subjects according to the ideal careers they are pursuing.

                  GitHub was used in the same capacity as assignment 2, code was
                  pushed to make a repository. Although this assignment didn’t
                  see the team all contributing to the pushes. It was assigned
                  to a few members instead of the whole team, which helped with
                  consistency. Hence, the number of commits per person does not
                  define how our tasks had been completed. It is to be noted
                  that tasks were equally divided, and all members put in a lot
                  of effort.

                     new talent. The program will be used by HR teams, hiring
                     managers, talent acquisition, and anyone involved in a
                     company’s hiring process. InRecruit will provide them with
                     an easy to navigate interface, built-in curated job
                     description libraries, critically it will offer
                     recommendations for improvement, identity potential bias,
                     and help organisations track and improve the inclusiveness
                     of their job descriptions.

                     When looking to hire new staff, rarely will an organisation
                     deliberately set out to exclude entire groups within the
                     population. In fact, in the last five years, there has been
                     an increasing focus globally on diversity and inclusion in
                     the workplace. Market leaders across the IT industry have
                     added Chief Diversity Officers and Managers to their teams
                     including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Dropbox,
                     Salesforce, and Airbnb (TechRepublic, 2016). Studies by
                     both Forbes and Harvard Business School reinforce the
                     benefits of diversity on both the innovation and financial
                     performance of organisations.

                     Competition for talent is fierce in today’s global economy,
                     so companies need to have plans in place to recruit,
                     develop, and retain a diverse workforce. (Forbes, 2011)

                     Understanding how to be inclusive when writing a job
                     description and applying that consistently across an
                     organisation is the challenge faced by most companies.
                     InRecruit will help organisations in their quest to attract
                     diverse talent by simplifying this critical part of the
                     hiring process.

                     Bridging the gap between recruiters and candidates,
                     InRecruit offers employers a tool to help quickly and
                     easily build inclusive job descriptions, optimised to
                     attract the broadest range of potential candidates to the
                     organisation. With a simple to use interface, recruiters
                     can select from pre-defined fields and the tool populates
                     an inclusive job description, provides suggestions and
                     recommendations on how to improve your job description, and
                     supports approval workflows and automatic job posting.
                     Based on current best practice, whilst removing as much
                     bias as possible from the process, InRecruit reduces the
                     workload of managers, human resources (HR), and talent
                     acquisition teams. Utilising industry standards,
                     organisational preferences and data gathered through the
                     application process the software further refines and
                     learns, to remain relevant over time.

                     There are lots of tools available in the market that assist
                     with building static job descriptions. What makes InRecruit
                     different is that it has inclusivity built-in, end to end,
                     helping organisations stand out in competitive markets, and
                     enabling them to attract a broader range of candidates. The
                     area of inclusive hiring has had a lot written about it,
                     but in terms of tools to support organisations, there are
                     very few available. When it comes to key features such as
                     analytics, benchmarking, market-specific insights, and
                     on-demand training, there are no applications that can
                     deliver all these features, as well as support inclusive
                     features such as keyword screening, bias analytics, and
                     recommendations.

                     Why does diversity matter to an organisation? Research
                     published by McKinsey shows that diversity has a direct
                     correlation to financial results.

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                     Forbes found that diversity in an organisation was critical
                     to global success, as well as improving innovation within a
                     company. With financial gains on the line, there is a great
                     incentive for organisations to be genuinely focused on
                     increasing diversity. Hiring diverse talent is not that
                     simple though. One of the big challenges in attracting
                     diverse talent to an organisation is known as
                     self-screening. Self-screening is where a candidate reads a
                     job advertisement and decides that they do not meet the
                     stated criteria, education, or experience requirements and
                     therefore do not apply for the role – never allowing the
                     employer to review the candidate. This act of
                     self-screening is much more prominent in women than it is
                     in men. Research by information technology company Hewlett
                     Packard, revealed women will not apply for an advertised
                     job role unless they believe they meet 100% of the listed
                     criteria, whereas men will apply when they meet around 60%.
                     The inclusion of extraneous or over-inflated job
                     requirements is costing employers their candidates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     To address this, organisations must utilise inclusive
                     hiring methods and standards. Job descriptions are the
                     initial window of insight into organisations and an oft
                     lost opportunity to not only find the right candidate for
                     the role but display the business’s culture. Describing the
                     requirements of the position is the point at which
                     companies are unknowingly disconnecting with potential
                     future employees. What is said and how it is worded is
                     critical when competing for talent. In 2019 Harvard
                     Business Review researched why women do not apply for
                     roles. Their research identifies narrow job descriptions,
                     non-inclusive language, and culture as critical factors
                     that are deterring women from applying for jobs. A job
                     description can seem like such a simple thing to change,
                     but the impact it can have on hiring responses is
                     significant. As discussed, there has been a lot of research
                     in this area around inclusive hiring, but to date, no
                     simple IT solutions for employers to implement to aid them
                     in doing this better.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Effectively improving diversity within talent pipelines is
                     as simple as tweaking relevant job descriptions. The
                     challenge employers face is knowing which information needs
                     changing, what elements are important, and building those
                     elements into a compelling, engaging, and realistic job
                     narrative. Most managers find themselves time-poor and the
                     recruitment function in many organisations is stretched
                     across multiple roles, offshored, or using a company
                     standard that has existed for many years. The simple act of
                     including a non-essential degree requirement, or specifying
                     that the job requires extensive travel, when in fact it is
                     not an excessive element of the role, are just two examples
                     of negative descriptors organisations add to their job
                     requirements daily, without realising the proportion of
                     candidates they have unintentionally excluded.

                     The talent pool for female candidates in STEM areas such as
                     IT is already small. A 2019 research report by CUPA HR
                     shows that in the US, only 26% of students undertaking
                     mathematical and computing studies at College are female.
                     When you add factors such as ethnicity, the percentages are
                     tiny. In Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
                     (2020) has almost identical figures for the percentages of
                     women engaged in IT studies.

                     immediately increase the number of candidates applying for
                     roles and give organisations greater reach and diversity

                     The concept behind InRecruit is well aligned to current IT
                     trends in a number of ways. Firstly, IT is one of the
                     industries where the conversation around diversity and
                     inclusion has really grown over recent years. As mentioned
                     in the Topic section above, technical industry leaders
                     worldwide have seen this trend and added Diversity Officers
                     and Managers to their workforces. This shows that the
                     subject matter of our project is well aligned to the IT
                     industry itself. The second facet of the alignment is the
                     platform we are proposing. The InRecruit platform has been
                     designed with consideration for the latest trends in IT,
                     using these as key elements or enablers for the platform.
                     For example, the platform will make use of chatbots, AI,
                     cloud based services and interfaces designed to support a
                     mobile workforce. These elements demonstrate our knowledge
                     of the technologies available in the market, as well as how
                     to bring them together into a cohesive end user experience.
                     The development of InRecruit would show a potential
                     employer our understanding of the challenges the industry
                     faces in terms of attracting key talent, as well as our
                     ability to identify and appropriately utilise modern
                     technologies to address those challenges.

                     To understand whether InRecruit has market plausibility a
                     comparison of competitors that are already active within
                     the market needed to be undertaken. Research was conducted
                     into the top nine applications and software packages that
                     are currently available in the market that provide
                     capabilities around building job descriptions.

                     Categories weren’t predetermined, they were added as the
                     team assessed each application, removing bias from the
                     assessment process. If the team had assessed these against
                     a predetermined list, it would be easy to show our own
                     application as being completely new and innovative.
                     Instead, as the team found a new application, its key
                     features were added to the assessment table.

                  <p>
                     We have taken the core features held by the majority of the
                     competitor applications or programs and identified these as
                     core to InRecruit. We have then taken the less common
                     features that focus on bias and recommendations to help
                     InRecruit align to this niche within the recruitment tool
                     market. Finally, we have looked at what would improve a
                     user experience, or provide a greater market edge to users
                     of InRecruit and identified three key features that form
                     part of our platform. These are all covered in greater

                  <p>
                     The aim of InRecruit is to deliver a software platform that
                     enables organisations to easily create, save, and share
                     highly inclusive job descriptions. InRecruit will be used
                     by organisations who are looking to improve the diversity
                     of their workforce, and therefore benefit from the creative
                     and financial benefits of a diverse workforce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Using a combination of organisational requirements, in
                     concert with current research in the field of inclusion,
                     employers will have at their fingertips a tool that can
                     create custom job descriptions, optimised to attract
                     diverse talent to the organisation. InRecruit aims to take
                     the guess work out of inclusive hiring and assist in
                     creating a consistent hiring experience for candidates,
                     whether the organisation is 10 people or 100,000 people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     By solving the challenges inherent in creating an unbiased
                     job description, InRecruit will help organisations add
                     greater diversity to their workforce, and therefore
                     increase their potential for profitability.

                  <h3>Goals</h3>
                  <p>
                     To help drive towards the overarching aim, InRecruit has a
                     number of goals.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>
                        Simple to use interface to enable the introduction of
                        diverse job descriptions into any workplace. Being
                        inclusive isn’t always easy, and often people end up
                        ignoring it. This is not because they want to be
                        deliberately exclusive, but because they don’t know
                        where to start. The goal of InRecruit is to remove this
                        blocker by taking away the unknown of where to start. A
                        simple, user friendly interface means that anyone in the
                        organisation can easily access the tool and start
                        building inclusive job descriptions.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Search functionality that is intuitive and returns
                        relevant templates or recommendations. Having made a
                        start, finding what you need easily is critical. If it
                        takes too long or is hard to find what you are looking
                        for, you have lost your audience. InRecruit aims to have
                        an intuitive search interface that utilises predictive
                        text, as well as making use of machine learning to help
                        it better understand what the organisation tends to look
                        for, the industry it operates in and therefore make
                        better recommendations.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Recommendations that are actionable, easy to understand
                        and improve the quality of the candidates an
                        organisation sees. Having a database and being able to
                        search it are important, but the crux of the InRecruit
                        functionality is its ability to make recommendations on
                        ways to edit or alter job descriptions to improve their
                        appeal. The ultimate goal of this is to increase the
                        breadth and quality of candidates that an organisation
                        sees applying for its jobs. The recommendation engine
                        needs to be carefully tuned to make sure that it isn’t
                        bringing in new biases and that any changes that are
                        recommended are easy for the user to accept.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Integration that makes it simple to seek approval and
                        release a job description. Having written a new job
                        description, you don’t want users to be taking their
                        content offline in order to get approvals, or to release
                        it to market. If they were to do this, it would reduce
                        the ability of the tool to both learn from and report on
                        progress. That is why integration across workflows and
                        job seeker platforms is a critical goal for the
                        platform.

                  <h3>Plan and Progress</h3>
                  <p>
                     The planning for InRecruit has been an iterative process.
                     From the first inception of the idea, to the detail the
                     team has built out, we have moved through a number of
                     phases and development milestones. These are covered in
                     more detail below.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Ideation</h4>
                  <p>
                     To get us started, we undertook a phase of ideation. The
                     purpose of going through an ideation activity was to get
                     the team to provide their unfiltered thoughts and ideas
                     around the proposed project, gain a deeper understanding of
                     the proposal and test whether we felt it was achievable or
                     not. The high-level concept of the platform was shared with
                     the team as a whole and everyone contributed ideas, or
                     relayed their understanding of what it was designed to
                     achieve. This helped to highlight gaps in the concept, as
                     well as solidify our understanding of what it was we were
                     seeking to achieve. Out of the ideation phase we developed
                     a series of ideas of what the platform could potentially be
                     used for and features it could have. Most of these features
                     have been retained in the scoped as we have moved through
                     iterations. There were some features we discussed, but did
                     not move forward with. These include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        The ability for candidates to upload their CVs to see if
                        they were a match for the job. It was felt that this was
                        outside of the core goals and aim for the project. The
                        main audience for the product is recruiters, and so
                        although this could be a feature for future iterations,
                        it wasn’t included in the project scope at this stage.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Load and analyse all of an organisation’s existing job
                        descriptions. Loading existing job descriptions is a
                        feature that is available within the tool, but analysing
                        them immediately for inclusiveness hasn’t been built in
                        explicitly as part of the current scope. During
                        discussions within the team it was felt that this kind
                        of analysis could be misleading. If there are duplicate
                        job descriptions or ones for roles that require lots of
                        travel, where most roles don’t, these figures would skew
                        any statistics. It was decided that to build a baseline
                        score of inclusivity, the system would take the new job
                        descriptions as they were created. This means each one
                        assessed is a discrete role, where recommendations have
                        been made and users have made choices around whether to
                        incorporate the recommendations or not. This gives an
                        organisation a better benchmark, also showing it
                        opportunities for improvement and reducing the ability
                        to discount the statistics provided as being old, or
                        unrepresentative.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Cognitive services for document translation. One concept
                        we toyed with was the ability to use cognitive services
                        to support document translation. The team were exploring
                        ways of making the tool support multi-national
                        organisations. This is a good feature for future
                        potential iterations, but would require a significant
                        amount of investigation as inclusivity is different
                        across cultures and auto-translation could create
                        inconsistencies or erroneous recommendations.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Build approach. In original iterations, we were
                        exploring and proposing two different ways of building
                        the platform. One was a custom build, the other using
                        existing software that could be linked together using
                        APIs and workflows. Although we haven’t definitively
                        ruled out the custom build approach, given a number of
                        the included scope covers features such as chatbots and
                        machine learning capabilities, our research is leaning
                        towards the use of a platform such as Azure or AWS,
                        where our development team could leverage built in
                        capabilities such as bot builders and pre-defined
                        algorithms to reduce the build cost. There are pros and
                        cons to both models of course. In the model where we
                        leverage existing cloud provider capabilities, it means
                        we are tied to a particular platform in order to provide
                        our service. This also has cost implications as we will
                        be paying to host the service, regardless of whether it
                        is being used. Building a standalone application makes
                        it platform agnostic to a certain extent, but means that
                        there are a lot more initial upfront costs to build key
                        capabilities.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Consolidation, competition, personas and a pivot</h4>
                  <p>
                     Having brainstormed ideas of what features the platform
                     needed to have, these were consolidated into a core list.
                     To help us work out the technical and functional
                     requirements for the platform we decided to create a set of
                     personas and associated user stories. This level of detail
                     was to help us really align and consolidate the core goals
                     of the platform. The three core personas we created to aid
                     our user story creation were:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Business owner – the business owner would be interested
                        in insights from the tool, payback metrics and ways of
                        proving the value of the cost of investments. Most of
                        the user stories for this persona related to tracking,
                        monitoring, dashboards and value realisation.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Hiring director/approver – this persona was for those
                        people in an organisation who were responsible for the
                        HR function, onboarding new people, and approving any
                        workflows related to releasing a new role to market. In
                        some organisations, this could be one person, or in
                        larger organisations, this could be multiple people. The
                        user stories were flexible and would enable this persona
                        to be multiple different people. User stories for this
                        persona related to approval workflows, tracking,
                        connection to internal and external tools for ease of
                        use and training availability.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        End user – this is the persona who would be building the
                        job descriptions. This could be a member of the HR team,
                        or the manager of the team the new recruit would belong
                        to, it all depends on the way in which an organisation
                        operates. The functionality aligned to these user
                        stories forms the core of the prototype that was
                        designed and the features in the MVP listed below. These
                        user stories are about how the interface operates, what
                        information or data the user wants to see and how they
                        can personalise their experience.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     Having taken the outputs from our ideation work and created
                     our core feature list, we conducted some market research.
                     It was at this point where we almost considered changing
                     our project focus. In retrospect, this detailed kind of
                     competitor research should have been done earlier in the
                     process and is a key learning for the team. What the
                     research uncovered is that there are a couple of similar
                     tools available in the market. The team knew that there
                     were job description builder tools available in the market,
                     but we were surprised to also find ones that had
                     functionality around bias and inclusion. These are included
                     above in our Landscape section. Textio had all the features
                     that we had identified we wanted for InRecruit, leaving us
                     questioning whether to move forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We created a matrix to look at key functionality across all
                     of the applications, which helped us easily see
                     commonalities and differences across the platforms already
                     available in the market. This enabled us to do two things:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>
                        Confirm the core features that any job description
                        builder application had to have.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Find the set of features that few or none of the
                        existing applications had, which aligned to our goals
                        and aim for InRecruit.
                     </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                     It was the second point above that enabled us to move
                     forward with the project. Knowing that we had found some
                     unique selling points and a way to differentiate ourselves
                     meant that InRecruit was still a viable project concept.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Plan A</h4>
                  <p>
                     Following on from Assignment 2, the plan was to build out
                     the MVP features. Team Eagle had identified these during
                     the assignment, and particularly as part of the competitor
                     research. The plan for Assignment 3 was to build the
                     following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Build, search for and store job descriptions</li>
                     <li>Workflows</li>
                     <li>Version history</li>
                     <li>Bias review and recommendations</li>
                     <li>Dashboards for analysis</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     To support Assignment 2 we had also done a lot of research
                     into the kind of available components and tools we could
                     use to help build our MVP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Of course, hindsight has shown us that we had missed a step
                     in our thinking and proposal for the next phase. How were
                     we going to fund this? How could we build this
                     functionality without incurring some potentially
                     significant costs? If this was a real project, what would
                     the logical next step be? As a team, we realised that in
                     this kind of real world scenario, we would more likely be
                     seeking seed funding to build out a Proof of Concept,
                     rather than jumping straight in to full development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This meant that we needed to pivot again to build an
                     appropriate set of artefacts, interfaces and documentation
                     aligned with this interim phase.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Current State</h4>
                  <p>
                     Having determined that building a fully functioning MVP was
                     not viable as our next phase, we determined that we needed
                     a prototype that could demonstrate the capabilities and
                     interface we were proposing. As finding funding was our
                     core focus, we knew we also needed to have a more detailed
                     technical architecture defined, to demonstrate that the
                     proposed platform was technically viable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The prototype was built using Adobe XD to create an
                     application-like interface to show potential investors what
                     the experience would be like.

                  <h3>Roles</h3>
                  <p>
                     Within the team we have defined roles around Architecture,
                     User Experience and Design to support the development of
                     the key initial assets. To really develop this platform,
                     funding would be required. Although some of the
                     functionality can be built relatively simply, to deliver
                     the high value content, such as chatbots, accessibility
                     scoring, and machine learning, investment is required. Our
                     focus has been getting a set of high-resolution mock-ups
                     and clickable wireframes produced that could be used for
                     the purposes of securing funding which would enable the
                     initial production of InRecruit.
                  </p>
                  <p>The roles we have focused on have been:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Technical design and architecture</li>
                     <li>User Experience and interface design</li>
                     <li>Asset design</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     These three roles enable us to build out the detail needed
                     to understand what is required technically to build the
                     platform end to end, whilst producing the assets required
                     to secure the necessary funding. This is aligned to our
                     Current State, which is covered above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Within the team, we have loosely aligned to the three roles
                     as follows:
                  </p>

                           potential investors to understand how the system will
                           operate and its technical viability. Nathan and Sarah
                           have looked at the high level design produced in
                           Assignment 2 and sought to take it to the next level,
                           showing how the platform will operate and the various
                           key features within it. Allocating Nathan and Sarah
                           to this stream is based around their existing roles
                           within the IT industry and their understanding of the
                           technical elements potentially required. Neither of
                           them are technically deep in the areas required for
                           this project, but can draw upon the resources
                           available to them to help build the necessary
                           content.

                           Hannah and Fatima both have experience and a desire
                           to build upon their skills in this area. Although
                           having some previous experience, the production of a
                           functioning prototype still required them to learn to
                           use new tools.

                           platform. Sarah’s focus has been on developing the
                           assets needed to approach investors and help them
                           understand what the product does, how it operates and
                           why they should invest in it. This plays to Sarah’s
                           strengths in marketing and bringing together all the
                           elements of the project into a single cohesive story.

                     Although the team was loosely aligned to the roles
                     identified above, each team member has moved to support
                     other streams as needed to help get particular activities
                     completed or provide support. These roles were aligned to
                     existing strengths, whilst still stretching the team and
                     helping them to build new capabilities.

                     To make InRecruit more durable, it will be built using data
                     science principles, using machine learning to provide users

                     scenarios and relevant recommendations for their job
                     descriptions. These recommendations will draw upon the data
                     gathered from InRecruit’s extensive database. This will
                     enable InRecruit to understand the connections between
                     skills, the value of those skills and their scarcity within
                     a given market. It can then provide recommendations based
                     on this information that enable managers to make better
                     informed decisions when publishing their job
                     advertisements.

                           The final decision will depend on the other
                           components of the platform that are selected.
                           Microsoft offers Bot Service out of the box that
                           enables you to use their Language Understanding

                           processing, as well as being able to quickly build
                           FAQ capabilities for the bot through the Q&A maker.
                           <br />
                           There are similar options available from other
                           providers such as TARS, which provides an extensive
                           bot library to build from, as does Flow XO. The key
                           choice here will be both platform, as well as cost,
                           as each bot building option has vastly different
                           pricing models from monthly charges to cost per
                           interaction.

                  <h4>Test plan</h4>
                  <p>
                     There will be two main phases to the testing conducted for
                     InRecruit. The first phase of the testing will be
                     pre-development, the main phase of testing will be during
                     development of the platform.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Pre-development testing</h5>
                  <p>
                     The pre-development testing is aimed at refining the user
                     stories and gauging interest in the features and
                     functionality of InRecruit. This phase of testing will
                     conducted using the prototype to help the test group get an
                     understanding for the potential usability of the tool and
                     to provide feedback into its development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This testing will be conducted before any of the technical
                     development is undertaken and will form an input into
                     finalising the MVP feature set, as well as end user design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The test audience for the pre-development testing will be
                     HR managers and hiring managers sourced from a range of
                     companies.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Development testing</h5>
                  <p>
                     Testing for the project itself will be done iteratively,
                     aligned with development. The development phase of the
                     project is planned to be agile and use sprints. As part of
                     each sprint, features built in that sprint will be tested
                     to ensure they not only work but meet the requirements of
                     the related user story and test cases. Testing will be
                     carried out by the developers as part of their activities
                     during the sprint, prior to finalisation. Any feature that
                     doesn’t pass testing will be passed back to the development
                     team to correct or include in a future backlog, depending
                     on the severity of the defect identified. Once testing has
                     been finalised, features will be marked complete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     After every second sprint, a showcase will be presented to
                     the full development team to enable refinement and refocus
                     of the solution, as needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is planned to commence
                     following the first show case, and will be conducted after
                     each showcase until the feature set for that phase is
                     complete. This testing will be conducted in parallel to
                     development to prevent the project from stalling while
                     features are tested. The output of UAT will be added to the
                     backlog if any further changes or refinement is required.

                     processes. The test cases are a critical part of the unit
                     and development testing as they support testing of the
                     technical functions of the platform. The functional
                     specifications and user stories are the key input into the
                     UAT testing.

                           prototype and the user stories to help build a full
                           picture of how users will interact with the platform,
                           and any amendments that need to be captured before

                  <p>
                     As defects are identified during testing, the defect
                     priority will be jointly agreed upon by the development
                     team. The team will triage the defect and fix all type 1
                     and type 2 defects before the end of the sprint if
                     possible, and if not, they will be added to the following
                     sprint. The type 3 and 4 defects will be addressed through
                     the backlog process in a following sprint. Defect
                     priorities are shown in the following table.

                  <h3>Risks</h3>
                  <p>
                     With a large proportion of start-ups failing or being
                     abandoned during the initial stages (Australian Bureau of
                     Statistics 2020 (2)), it is critical to consider potential
                     risks to be faced during this process and minimise the
                     threats to the success of this initiative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The most significant risk identified is the lack of
                     experience of the team with the various tools being
                     proposed to develop InRecruit. This makes the process of
                     developing the product somewhat unpredictable and difficult
                     to accurately determine the timelines involved. Due care
                     has been taken to explore appropriate tools to use and the
                     likely timeframes involved. However, most team members have
                     no experience with these resources and could be misinformed
                     about whether certain elements are possible to create
                     and/or of the time investment required. Similarly, the team
                     is not experienced with the languages needed to build the
                     product. The scale of the challenge to gain enough
                     understanding of these languages to incorporate into a
                     functioning product is uncertain. To allow for these risks,
                     the extra time has been allocated in the project plan to
                     first learn the tool/language and then do the development
                     work and these timeframes will be monitored closely. There
                     may be a need to seek external expertise if deadlines are
                     missed which could be done by recruiting another team
                     member, seeking external input through employing
                     freelancers, or seeking input from the team’s network of IT
                     professionals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     There are existing products that are like InRecruit so
                     there is a risk of losing users to competitor products.
                     Particular attention will be paid to communicating the
                     unique features of InRecruit in its marketing strategy. The
                     up-front costs of the marketing required to find the users
                     to make the product successful is a significant risk.
                     Marketing is traditionally expensive but there are
                     lower-cost approaches to consider first to ensure there is
                     the market interest in this product before investing in
                     marketing which would require external investment. The team
                     plan to use their business networks to directly market to
                     businesses and these users will demonstrate the viability
                     of the product to seek external investment for a
                     substantial marketing campaign aimed at growing the user
                     base. This investment would also go towards covering the
                     costs of ongoing product development and user support with
                     the user feedback likely to highlight the need to add to
                     product capabilities as well as patch bugs identified.

                  <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
                  <p>
                     The team is using the same tools and processes for the
                     development of the project as agreed upon for Assignment 2.
                     This was decided as the team communicated effectively and
                     openly during the first assignment. The main tool used to
                     support communication has been Microsoft Teams (Teams). The
                     team agreed that the minimum level of participation
                     required in order to support effective communication would
                     be via twice weekly group meetings. These meetings were
                     scheduled on Sunday and Thursday evenings and the chair for
                     each meeting rotated, to share the responsibility across
                     the team. Making use of the learnings from Assignment 2,
                     the team have created a consistent agenda and minutes
                     template for meetings to enable quick sharing of
                     information and more effective communication.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In Assignment 2, the team used OneNote to share some
                     information. During Assignment 3, the team have focused on
                     keeping conversations and key information within the chat
                     function of Teams. This was to reduce locations where
                     people had to look for information and reduce issues with
                     people missing content. Team Eagle agreed to implement some
                     informal Teams usage guidelines. These guidelines include
                     having team members add headings to their posts, and
                     tagging appropriate people, to enable faster communication
                     and identification of relevant topics to contribute to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The team have been constructive in criticism and
                     enthusiastic in relation to taking on tasks for the
                     assignment. All members have been sensitive to communicate
                     in a helpful way and aware of not crossing boundaries that
                     could offend a member or hinder progress. There have been
                     no fallouts or communication problems with each member of
                     Team Eagle clearly and successfully able to communicate.

               To support the design and build of the final program, there are
               four key roles that will be needed:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Security engineer</li>
               <li>Data engineer</li>
               <li>UX designer</li>
               <li>Application developer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Job descriptions for these four roles are included below. As the
               project relates to building inclusive job descriptions, we have
               used inclusive job design techniques and parameters for each of
               these roles.

            <h1>Reflections</h1>

               <h2>Team's Reflection</h2>

               <h3>What went well?</h3>
               <p>
                  As part of Assignment 2, the team reflected on some of the
                  things that could be improved and have implemented those on
                  entering Assignment 3. In particular, the creation and use of
                  consistent minutes and agenda templates have saved a lot of
                  time for everyone, making it easier to capture, share and
                  communicate with more clarity.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The group have continued to be positive about their
                  contributions, enthusiastically committing to do their portion
                  of the assignment, consistently attending meetings and
                  reaching out for feedback or help. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Everyone in the team has been contributing and the group have
                  appreciated the ongoing willingness to peer review content as
                  well as people stepping up and taking on extra work where they
                  can. This has been particularly important in relation to the
                  building of the prototype and creation of the video. These
                  elements are mentioned below as part of what the team found
                  most surprising but have certainly also been the most
                  challenging as they required significant tool research and
                  then learning.
               </p>
               <p>
                  One final observation is that there has been no conflict
                  within the group and each member has provided feedback to
                  support others with their components of the work, improve
                  their understanding of particular topics and share their
                  expertise.
               </p>

               <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
               <p>
                  In Assignment 2 keeping track of conversations, content and
                  threads in Teams was challenging. This has improved with
                  Assignment 3 through the use of some informal Teams standards
                  such as using headings to identify conversation topics and
                  tagging people so they can see important messages. This is
                  probably still an area for improvement as messages aren’t
                  always being attached to threads and can easily get lost.
               </p>

               <h3>What was surprising?</h3>
               <p>
                  The most surprising part of the process for Assignment 3 has
                  been the amount of time needed to learn to use some of the key
                  tools required to execute the project prototype and video
                  elements. The team members who committed to completing these
                  components of the project have had to dedicate a large amount
                  of time to learning the tools to enable them to complete their
                  outputs. The team potentially underestimated the time
                  investment needed for this component of the assignment.  After
                  investing significant time, it was difficult to accept that
                  learning some of these tools was not achievable in the short
                  time frame.
               </p>

               <h3>What was learnt about groups?</h3>
               <p>
                  Each individual brings different skills and experiences. When
                  these are considered in the task allocation and work process,
                  they benefit the whole team and allow a group to reach their
                  desired outcomes and goals with ease.

               <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>

               <h3>Hannah</h3>
               <p>
                  Hannah felt the group worked smoothly with this assignment,
                  having had the experience of working with the same group for
                  Assignment 2. Each member contributed well taking on the
                  responsibilities of the project tasks and communication
                  equally. The main communication was through Teams meetings
                  which were chaired by a new member twice each week and via the
                  Teams chat. GitHub did not reflect on the amount of work each
                  member did as it was viewed as a task to be distributed,
                  therefore only two members needed to make commits to it.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Communication went very well with this assignment, members had
                  experience with the tools and as a group and built on a good
                  foundation from assignment 2. Had the group been assigned more
                  time and resources a more professional level of presentation
                  and prototype would have been achieved. Hannah found the
                  expectation of the amount of work surprising and was
                  frustrated with the lack of resources. Hannah has learned, the
                  longer a group works together, the more productive they are.
               </p>

               <h3>Fatima</h3>
               <p>
                  Fatima is very satisfied with the team’s work and
                  communication process. She believes that the team members are
                  now more comfortable with each other, which contributes to
                  making teamwork more interactive and fun. Each member took
                  full responsibility for completing the allocated tasks at a
                  good standard. Fatima feels there was never a time throughout
                  this group work when anyone presented unsatisfactory work that
                  needed a large amount of editing. Everything was on point and
                  every member was able to stay focused on their tasks without
                  worrying about the quality or delivery of other tasks. This
                  shows that trust and ownership of tasks played an important
                  role in Team Eagle’s success.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Fatima finds it surprising how there were no issues throughout
                  the time in which Team Eagle worked together. Her confidence
                  in group work has definitely increased. However, she now has
                  high expectations of how a group should work. Considering that
                  her first experience of teamwork was very good, she is unsure
                  how the set expectations will affect her later when working
                  with different teams. In Assignment two Fatima had struggled
                  with time management issues which she managed to overcome in
                  Assignment three. Like other members, Fatima has also come to
                  realise that the longer you work with a team, the better the
                  outcomes and achievements.
               </p>

               <h3>Nathan</h3>
               <p>
                  Nathan cannot believe we are at the end of the assignments
                  already. It has gone way too quick. Nathan has really enjoyed
                  working with this amazing group. Everyone has worked well
                  together. Helping each other when needed. There have not been
                  any arguments.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This assignment has given us more exposure to different tools
                  which Nathan has enjoyed learning although has realized that
                  some cannot be learned in 2 weeks. Nathan enjoyed being taken
                  out of his comfort zone and pushed to his limits as he has
                  never put together a video before. He thoroughly enjoyed it
                  although there were late and sleepless nights when new ideas
                  would be thought of.
               </p>

               <h3>Sarah C</h3>
               <p>
                  Sarah was fascinated by the way in which the group flowed
                  seamlessly from one assignment to the next. Having worked
                  together previously there was a definite comfort around where
                  strengths were and there was a conscious decision to try and
                  play to those when the first call was held, and work was
                  allocated. One element that has worked particularly well
                  within the team is the ability to be truly agile. Each time it
                  has become apparent that perhaps the workload isn’t even, or
                  someone is struggling, the team simply pivots, reviews and
                  provides support as needed. In Sarah’s experience this is the
                  time when the most drama and conflict usually occur in teams.
                  Instead of anyone complaining, or trying to avoid any
                  additional work, the entire team has flowed to where the work
                  was, provided support and then moved back to their allocated
                  tasks. This kind of intuitive working and drama-less approach
                  have been incredibly refreshing, as well as making sure that
                  everyone has a voice and opportunity to contribute.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In order to get teams to focus or operate effectively, it is
                  common that one or two people take the lead. In Team Eagle
                  that hasn’t happened. In each team meeting there is a
                  different chair and the team review the agenda, wait their
                  turn and try to be considerate of others when making
                  contributions. It a rarity to have a team without a singular
                  leader that is still incredibly productive. In Team Eagle this
                  is because each team member takes accountability for their
                  actions and what they have committed to – the cumulative
                  effect of aligned personal work ethics being the driving force
                  behind successfully completing the project requirements.
               </p>

               <h3>Sarah B</h3>
               <p>
                  Sarah thinks Team Eagle worked well together and were all
                  prepared to strive towards a good outcome, actively
                  participating throughout. As with all group work, it was
                  challenging to have schedules/work patterns which did not
                  always match up and where tasks were not ready to be delegated
                  until later into the project. This is certainly not a
                  criticism, just part of teamwork. However, working with a
                  group of different skills and perspectives also undoubtedly
                  improved the quality and scope of what was produced in this
                  task.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Sarah reflected that the Team’s excellent attendance of the
                  twice-weekly meetings was critical in facilitating its strong
                  communication and steady progress in what often felt like an
                  insurmountable task. For the scale of what was required, Team
                  Eagle had to separate the project into individual components
                  and members were essentially required to specialise. Sarah
                  individually learned a lot, exploring new programs and
                  concepts. But with each team member on a similar individual
                  journey, what the collective Team Eagle was able to learn is
                  incredible. Sarah was surprised by the progress the Team was
                  able to make in less than 2 months, starting out as strangers.
                  It makes the thought of pursuing a start-up seem like an
                  almost achievable goal.
