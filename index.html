                  <p>
                     Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently
                     lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high
                     school in 1999, then, after studying film in college, she
                     moved to New Zealand for five years, where she opened a
                     retail store. After moving back to Australia in 2007,
                     Hannah ran an online wholesale and retail business for
                     twelve years before deciding to pivot her career and is now
                     studying IT at RMIT University. Currently, she is working
                     as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for an online
                     retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with her
                     family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
                     board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah
                     believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when
                     researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                     to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                     look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                     realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but
                     rapidly changing the way we live and work in all
                     industries. Initially being drawn to design because of her
                     creative background, she started to investigate the user
                     experience and user interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite
                     her. After researching the impact of digital monitoring
                     technologies on the Australian populace, she also became
                     very engrossed with the development and ethics of modern
                     technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience including
                     relational skills, small business, strategic planning, as
                     well as design competence. She is also familiar with the
                     Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and online
                     communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
                     Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

                  <p>
                     Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                     Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in
                     Pakistan with her family and grandparents. Being a dual
                     nationality holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu
                     fluently and has also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has
                     recently completed Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to
                     complete a Bachelor of Arts degree (Majoring in Digital
                     Experience and Interaction design) within the next 3 years.
                     Fatima's interest in IT developed with the efforts of her
                     father, a software developer, who was always convincing her
                     to follow his lead into becoming a software developer too.
                     However, it wasn't until her father started a remote job
                     that Fatima started to take interest in this field. Due to
                     her love for art and design, she has now decided to become
                     a digital designer and is studying hard to achieve her
                     goal. Fatima has no prior experience in the IT field except
                     for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design
                     essential skills from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to
                     become a successful digital designer and travel the world.
                     In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking and decorating
                     cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always looking forward
                     to the summer holidays season in which she enjoys
                     travelling with family and cousins.

                     Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                     35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being
                     Portra 400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and
                     learning something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a
                     kid when he got his first family computer. He was always on
                     it, mostly playing games at that age. It grew from there
                     when Nathan became more interested in what his dad was
                     doing as he was an IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan
                     enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so he could
                     follow in his dad's footsteps. He has now been working in
                     IT for the last ten years across four different jobs and
                     has spent the last nine years on two separate support
                     desks. This has given him relevant experience in IT and
                     good exposure to different technologies. Nathan's current
                     job has given him more experience in software development,
                     which is where he sees his career going. Nathan brings many
                     skills to the team. Some of his skills and qualifications
                     (apart from being a GitHub master!) are:

                  <p>
                     Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has
                     dual citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone
                     who strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees
                     in Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                     collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art".
                     The concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                     somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some
                     joy to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had
                     never deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the
                     industry in general. She had spent a lot of her career
                     working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia,
                     she took the opportunity to try out a new industry -
                     telecommunications. Over time, she moved into a project
                     role, and that was her first real exposure to what is
                     possible with IT. She learned about EPICs, features, user
                     stories, and wireframes, an entire world she had never
                     known existed. Sarah was hooked. Naturally, when a friend
                     reached out and asked if she would be interested in joining
                     Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and there, she has found
                     her home. Sarah has worked in management roles for several
                     years, across a few different industries. As a result, she
                     has multiple skills and experiences which include:

                  <p>
                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.

               <p>
                  Team Eagle worked very well together for Assignment 2. Every
                  member was active and contributed well throughout the
                  assignment. Tasks were divided evenly, and members were always
                  ready to voluntarily help others when needed. Everyone
                  appreciated each other’s efforts. In terms of delivery of
                  work, all members ensured their tasks were completed on time
                  and hence, the team managed to submit work that they were
                  satisfied with. Observing our work in assignment 2, we now
                  have a better understanding of each members capabilities and
                  strengths which have been considered when dividing our tasks
                  for assignment 3. Although the team faced no challenges in
                  communication, there were some problems due to our overall
                  lack of experience with MS Teams and GitHub. Learning from our
                  work in assignment 2, the group has made some changes in the
                  way we use MS Teams. To avoid confusion, a new channel was
                  created for A3 communication purposes. A folder was created
                  for all meeting agenda/minutes files. This will allow members
                  to easily locate them when working on the tools section. The
                  team will follow a uniform format when noting down meeting
                  agendas and minutes. We will be also creating new folders to
                  categorise all our files as we go along. This was something we
                  did later on in assignment 2. Managing and keeping our
                  branches up to date with each other was a major problem that
                  we faced throughout assignment 2. In order to avoid wasting
                  time in merging our previous branches, we have deleted all our
                  individual branches and created new ones from the master
                  branch. Each member will make sure to pull in all changes from
                  the master branch to their personal branches whenever they
                  plan on making some changes to the HTML or CSS.

                  To achieve her goals Sarah will be completing RMIT’s Bachelor
                  in IT degree. Throughout the 3 years of studying, she also
                  plans to gain hands on experience, mentoring and interactions
                  across the industry. Sarah will participate in programs,
                  conferences/events, and take different exams including the
                  AZ-500, AZ-300 and 301 exams to earn relevant knowledge and
                  skills for her ideal role.

                  Sarah hopes to gain the basic skills of web/app design by
                  completing the Bachelor of Information Technology with a minor
                  in Internet Design. She has her eyes on a couple of software
                  companies operating out of Hobart which she plans to approach
                  for internship opportunities alongside her studies. This will
                  help her to start gaining professional experience earlier on
                  and develop a convincing portfolio. With this she hopes to
                  land an entry-level job in the field, which will be the start
                  to her progress in gaining several years of professional
                  software development experience. Sarah also plans to volunteer
                  her skills for businesses she has relationships with to help
                  improve their web presence and mobile functionality.

               <p>
                  A major part of work in the IT field consists of constant
                  learning and hence all members of the team plan to complete
                  micro courses and university level subjects/degrees as a part
                  of their career plans. This is normally expected within the IT
                  field as new technologies are constantly being introduced
                  which change the way we work.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Both Hannah and Fatima plan on working in the design field,
                  but the skills required for their ideal jobs and career plans
                  are very different. This is mainly because of the experience
                  both members have. While one is working towards a senior
                  digital designer role, the other is already a digital designer
                  and hopes to become a Research design director. However, there
                  is still some similarity in their career plans as both aim to
                  work as a UX/UI designer to gain the experience and skills
                  required for their desired roles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  On the other hand, although Sarah Carney’s and Hannah’s ideal
                  jobs may sound totally different, there is similarity in the
                  generic and IT skills required for both these roles. Some the
                  common skills include:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Leadership</li>
                  <li>Team building</li>
                  <li>Risk management</li>
                  <li>Strategic planning</li>
                  <li>Relationship management</li>
                  <li>Agile development</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  Despite the similarities of generic/IT skills the two members
                  have very different career plans to achieve their goals (as
                  mentioned above). Of course, this is due to the differing
                  nature of their ideal jobs.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The skills required for Sarah Brinckman’s ideal job (Mobile
                  developer) have similarities with most of the other members’
                  job skills. There are also similarities between Sarah
                  Brinckman and Fatima’s career plans apart from their planned
                  studies. While Fatima hopes to Major in Design with elective
                  subjects from Information Technology, Sarah Brinckman plans to
                  do the opposite with the main focus on a Bachelor of
                  Information Technology consisting of a minor in Internet
                  design. Alongside their studies, both aim to work some entry
                  level jobs in their respective areas to gain experience and
                  enhance their portfolios. After this they will begin gaining
                  the years of experience required for their ideal jobs through
                  different job/roles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Nathan, Sarah Brinckman, and Sarah Carney all are working
                  towards the Bachelor of Information technology provided by
                  RMIT university. However, while Sarah Brinckman will be
                  minoring in Internet Design, Nathan chooses to complete his
                  degree with a minor in Economics. Both have chosen their minor
                  subjects according to the ideal careers they are pursuing.
