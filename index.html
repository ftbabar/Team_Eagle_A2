                  <p>
                     Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently
                     lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high
                     school in 1999, then, after studying film in college, she
                     moved to New Zealand for five years, where she opened a
                     retail store. After moving back to Australia in 2007,
                     Hannah ran an online wholesale and retail business for
                     twelve years before deciding to pivot her career and is now
                     studying IT at RMIT University. Currently, she is working
                     as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for an online
                     retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with her
                     family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
                     board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah
                     believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when
                     researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                     to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                     look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                     realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but
                     rapidly changing the way we live and work in all
                     industries. Initially being drawn to design because of her
                     creative background, she started to investigate the user
                     experience and user interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite
                     her. After researching the impact of digital monitoring
                     technologies on the Australian populace, she also became
                     very engrossed with the development and ethics of modern
                     technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience including
                     relational skills, small business, strategic planning, as
                     well as design competence. She is also familiar with the
                     Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and online
                     communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
                     Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

                  <p>
                     Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                     Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in
                     Pakistan with her family and grandparents. Being a dual
                     nationality holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu
                     fluently and has also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has
                     recently completed Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to
                     complete a Bachelor of Arts degree (Majoring in Digital
                     Experience and Interaction design) within the next 3 years.
                     Fatima's interest in IT developed with the efforts of her
                     father, a software developer, who was always convincing her
                     to follow his lead into becoming a software developer too.
                     However, it wasn't until her father started a remote job
                     that Fatima started to take interest in this field. Due to
                     her love for art and design, she has now decided to become
                     a digital designer and is studying hard to achieve her
                     goal. Fatima has no prior experience in the IT field except
                     for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design
                     essential skills from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to
                     become a successful digital designer and travel the world.
                     In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking and decorating
                     cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always looking forward
                     to the summer holidays season in which she enjoys
                     travelling with family and cousins.

                     Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                     35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being
                     Portra 400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and
                     learning something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a
                     kid when he got his first family computer. He was always on
                     it, mostly playing games at that age. It grew from there
                     when Nathan became more interested in what his dad was
                     doing as he was an IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan
                     enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so he could
                     follow in his dad's footsteps. He has now been working in
                     IT for the last ten years across four different jobs and
                     has spent the last nine years on two separate support
                     desks. This has given him relevant experience in IT and
                     good exposure to different technologies. Nathan's current
                     job has given him more experience in software development,
                     which is where he sees his career going. Nathan brings many
                     skills to the team. Some of his skills and qualification
                     (apart from being a GitHub master!) are:

                  <p>
                     Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has
                     dual citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone
                     who strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees
                     in Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                     collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art".
                     The concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                     somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some
                     joy to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had
                     never deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the
                     industry in general. She had spent a lot of her career
                     working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia,
                     she took the opportunity to try out a new industry -
                     telecommunications. Over time, she moved into a project
                     role, and that was her first real exposure to what is
                     possible with IT. She learned about EPICs, features, user
                     stories, and wireframes, an entire world she had never
                     known existed. Sarah was hooked. Naturally, when a friend
                     reached out and asked if she would be interested in joining
                     Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and there, she has found
                     her home. Sarah has worked in management roles for several
                     years, across a few different industries. As a result, she
                     has multiple skills and experiences which include:

                  <h3>Sarah Taulava Brinckman (s3889052)</h3>
                  <img src="images/profile-photo-sarah-b.png" class="rounded float-end" alt="" width="200" height="200">
                  <p>
                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.

               <h2>Online Test Outcomes</h2>
               <p>
                  Our group is well-balanced when it comes to the members'
                  personality traits. When working in a team, it is always
                  beneficial to have people that vary in the way they understand
                  and do things. One thing that we all have in common is the way
                  we cope with our emotions and make decisions. According to the
                  Myers Brigg results, all members rely on feeling rather than
                  thinking and think for the well-fare of others. Our main
                  question is: "who does this help?". This is evident within our
                  individual project ideas from assignment 1. When it comes to
                  our learning styles, the results also vary. Some members learn
                  better by reading and writing while others by listening,
                  speaking, or trying.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This information is definitely very helpful for the group. To
                  have effective communication with a positive outcome, one must
                  first understand who they are communicating with, and what
                  might be the best way to convey a message to them. By viewing
                  each other's test results, we can better make use of the
                  skills and traits each member brings with them. We will know
                  who may be the best one for a particular task and how to help
                  or give feedback to another member when needed. Not only does
                  this help other members, but every individual can also realise
                  their own weaknesses and work to overcome them in ways which
                  suit them the best. The result: Hopefully a very successful
                  and happy team!
               </p>

               <h2>Teams Ideal Jobs and Career Path</h2>

               <p>
                  Team Eagle’s career aspirations vary and correspondingly,
                  so do the career paths. While some members strive for management
                  roles such as Chief Information Officer or Research Director of
                  Engineering and Design, other members are interested in more
                  technically focused roles such as the path of a developer. Roles
                  of interest include a Senior Digital Designer, a Mobile Developer,
                  and a Full Stack Machine Learning Engineer. This variation is not
                  surprising given the different life and career stages each member
                  of the team is in.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Shown in the two tables below are the different skills required
                  and the responsibilities for each of the roles. The tables show
                  us the cross over in the skills and responsibilities for each of
                  the roles as well as the standalone skills required
               </p>

               </figure>

               <p>
                  Most of the team plan to complete the Bachelor of Information
                  Technology degree with RMIT, but that is where our career plans
                  diverge. Some are looking at internships, during the period of
                  the degree, to gain experience before exploring a role that will
                  take them a step closer to their ideal job. Others are looking at
                  moving directly into their first paying role on their way to
                  reaching their ideal job. Some of the first jobs being targeted
                  by the team on completion of the degree are data analyst, UX/UI
                  designer and web designer.
               </p>

               <p>
                  One member of the team has gone a step further with their career
                  plan by mapping out a three-year plan. This includes other courses
                  and programs along with industry certifications. Across the three
                  years, broadening their technical knowledge and understanding of
                  industry trends as well as seeking mentoring from someone in their
                  ideal role.
               </p>

               <p>
                  To conclude, this comparison shows, while most of our group are
                  aiming to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology degree,
                  there will be different outcomes and career trajectories. The
                  collective ideal jobs, whilst having some similar skills and
                  responsibilities, are all different.

            <h2>Jess Dodson - Customer Engineer (Microsoft)</h2>
            <article id="jess-dodson-job">
               <h3>The job</h3>
               <p>
                  Jess is in her second year of working for Microsoft as a
                  Customer Engineer. Jess’s love of IT started at a young age and was encouraged by her father who was a
                  System Engineer. She found she always loved computers and selected numerous IT subjects to pursue when
                  she started High School. Jess unfortunately didn’t achieve the results she had hoped to on leaving
                  school and took a six month break before she returned to IT. Jess enrolled initially for a Certificate
                  IV, and then Diploma in Network Engineering. With this knowledge, she started a role on an IT Help
                  Desk, while she studied for her Bachelor of IT. When asked about what was most valuable out of her
                  studies, Jess felt that the technical skills dated quickly, but that university had taught her how to
                  learn, which she finds critical in her current role.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Having previously worked as a System
                  Administrator, Jess has expertise in the area of security,
                  which is what she now predominantly specialises in. The main
                  focus of her current role is to support her customers in their
                  use, understanding and application of their Microsoft
                  technology investments. For Jess, this means the majority of
                  her time is spent with customers teaching, sharing,
                  demonstrating and troubleshooting.
               </p>
               <p>
                  With a background in government and higher education, these
                  tend to be the industries and customers she supports in her
                  work for Microsoft. Within these industries she observed that
                  "IT is seen as a cost sink" and that IT teams are always
                  trying to find ways of doing more with less and operating with
                  very lean teams. Throughout COVID Jess has seen a huge shift
                  in focus in these industries towards security. With the
                  increase in remote working and BYOD trends, identity,
                  authentication and end to end security conversations are her
                  core focus.

            <article id="jess-dodson-activities">
               <h3>The activities</h3>
               <p>
                  A typical day for a Customer Engineer depends on whether they
                  are scheduled to be with a customer or not. On a customer
                  facing day, typical activities include triaging email, seeing
                  what has come in overnight, preparing for the customer
                  presentation and checking any demo environments. It isn't
                  unusual for Jess to spend 6 - 10 hours on any given day in
                  Teams voice or video chats with customers - whether that is
                  teaching them something new, doing a demo, running an
                  assessment on existing deployments and infrastructure or
                  helping lead them through building something new in a lab or
                  their own environment. On average, Jess estimates she spends
                  75% - 80% of her time working directly with customers. She
                  considers herself to be a technical translator. To be
                  successful in her role, she needs to find ways of explaining
                  sometimes complex technical jargon and concepts in simple,
                  easy to consume ways. Her audiences can be anyone from the
                  helpdesk team to the CEO, which requires an aptitude for
                  understanding the audience and delivering a message they can
                  relate to or understand.
               </p>
               <p>
                  On days without customers, Jess focuses her time on technical
                  training and upskilling. Keeping current with the technology
                  she is delivering is critical. She is the face of Microsoft
                  into that customer and is often expected to know a lot about a
                  broad range of subjects. Jess actively sets aside time to make
                  sure she is up to date on product changes, proposed features,
                  as well as understanding what competitors are doing with their
                  products.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Jess regularly contributes to podcasts, interviews,
                  conferences and other speaking engagements. She is a sought
                  after presenter and dedicates additional time to building her
                  content for these sessions.
               </p>

               <p>A typical week for Jess could look something like this:</p>

               <img src="images/working-week.png" alt="Image of calendar" width="100%"/>

               <p>Jess faces two main challenges in her role:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Interaction. Currently Jess is required to deliver all her
                     work remotely. Hosting deeply technical calls with up to 25
                     people at a time, who are also all working remotely,
                     creates a real challenge in building a rapport, creating
                     personal engagement and driving interaction. For sessions
                     that can span multiple days, this is a real challenge when
                     trying to help customers get the most out of their
                     experience, at the same time as gauging whether the
                     material is pitched at the right level and people are all
                     following what is happening.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Articulating the why. The second challenge Jess faces is
                     articulating why customers should do what it is she is
                     recommending they do. With a lot of the assessments that
                     Jess does, there are usually recommendations or changes
                     that need to be made, some of which will have a financial
                     impact for an organisation. Jess must find ways of
                     delivering her reports or findings in a compelling manner
                     that enables the customer to take those recommendations
                     forward and sell them to their own internal stakeholders.

               </ol>

               <p>
                  Jess's most valuable technical skills at the moment relate to
                  security. She has skills across Azure IaaS which she leverages
                  on a weekly basis, but it is security tools and Azure Sentinel
                  and conversations about Security Incident and Event Management
                  (SIEM) specifically that are in the highest demand.
               </p>

               <p>
                  When taking on the Customer Engineer role, Jess was surprised
                  to find that Executive Presence was a skill she needed on an
                  almost daily basis. Often, she isn't talking to just other
                  technical professionals, but to business owners, investors and
                  C-level executives. This requires her to be compelling and
                  able to demonstrate great presence.
               </p>

               <p>
                  One of her favourite things about working in IT is that it is
                  ever changing. She enjoys the rapid pace of change and the
                  fact that she can never be sure what she will be working on in
                  the coming years.

               <h3>The interactions</h3>

               <p>
                  When working with customers, the following are the kinds of
                  roles Jess finds herself interacting with:
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Security analysts</li>
                  <li>System admins</li>
                  <li>Infrastructure engineers</li>
                  <li>Network engineers</li>
                  <li>CIO</li>
                  <li>CISO</li>
                  <li>CEO</li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  These interactions can vary across information gathering,
                  delivering technical training, providing a demonstration, or
                  presenting the outcome of an assessment. Given the broad range
                  of work that Jess delivers, it is unsurprising that she
                  interacts with such a broad range of roles whilst working with
                  customers.
               </p>

               <p>
                  At Microsoft, Jess has a second set of internal stakeholders
                  that she interacts with each week. These include:
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>
                     Account Managers - as they "own" the customer relationships
                     and can share key information about the customer itself
                     such as internal structures, who the main stakeholders are,
                     and any current work being done with the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Cloud Solution Architects - who might also be working with
                     the same customer and delivering POC engagements or other
                     related technical activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Account Technology Strategists - work with customers to
                     support the development of their ongoing digital strategy,
                     including demonstrating new technology as it is released.
                     Jess needs to know what is being shared or shown to the
                     customer, so her presentations are aligned.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Account Executive - the Account Executive owns the sales
                     strategy for a particular customer and Jess will work with
                     them to understand what is currently planned or can share
                     any insights she gains from the work she does for them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Her manager - Jess has a manager who supports a group of
                     Customer Engineers and is there to assist Jess with any
                     challenges she is facing, help her build and execute on her
                     personal development plan and provide coaching to help her
                     growth.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  The final, and perhaps most significant group of people that
                  Jess interacts with internally are other Customer Engineers.
                  Through Teams channels and distribution lists she and her
                  fellow Customer Engineers form a strong support network. As a
                  group they are able to share ideas, updates on product
                  changes, but perhaps most importantly, they provide a valuable
                  source of information to each other. No one person could
                  possibly know the depth and breadth of all products developed
                  by Microsoft, but the team of engineers are able to support
                  each other and find the answers quickly to almost any customer
                  challenge. Jess has actively cultivated her network to help
                  her be more able to support her customers when they have
                  questions she doesn't have an immediate answer to.

            <article id="jess-dodson-thoughts">
               <h3>Thoughts on Team Eagle's Project</h3>

               <p>
                  Jess is passionate about Diversity and Inclusion and speaks
                  publicly on the subject. She loved the idea of the project
                  that Team Eagle is pursuing and stated that she wished more
                  organisations had a tool like it. She could easily see the
                  potential application of IT in this space and identified some
                  of the elements that would help make it successful such as
                  Machine Learning and AI capabilities. On discussing potential
                  challenges, she flagged that she thought that defining the
                  parameters for inclusion could be the hardest part for the
                  team. Jess highlighted that what makes an inclusive job
                  description can be subjective and is reader dependent.
                  Her advice was to seek clarity around how inclusion was
                  defined and to be aware of the team’s own biases, as that is
                  what the tool is trying to solve for.

               <p>
                  When asked about an example of the work she does that best
                  captures the essence of the IT industry, Jess shared an
                  example of a Government customer she has been working with
                  over a long period of time. The customer has multitudes of
                  Microsoft products that were previously unused or
                  under-utilised. Often in her role, interactions are one off,
                  or single days. With this customer, Jess has been back four
                  times now. What has happened over this time is that she has
                  been able to assist them with increasing and building their
                  confidence with using their products. She has seen incredible
                  growth and learning from them as they have moved towards
                  greater technical maturity as an organisation. Jess feels that
                  IT is all about learning. The rate of change and innovation is
                  so high in this industry, you have to keep up or get left
                  behind, "If you don't like learning, you are going to be in
                  the wrong job".
               </p>

               <p>
                  Jess’s advice to those looking to get into the field of IT is
                  to learn as much as you can about a broad range of areas. She
                  feels that unless you know exactly what you want to do,
                  having a broad knowledge will help you in securing your first
                  IT roles. She also expressed that she felt the Bachelor of IT
                  was an excellent way for people to prepare for an IT career
                  given the breadth of content covered.

               Technical Lead was chosen for Hannah’s Burning Glass Match
               because her role would involve leading a large team of technical
               experts and was the closest fit. Big Data Engineer was chosen for
               Nathan as big data is usually associated with machine learning
               algorithms and this was the closest fit. ‘Full Stack Engineer’
               did not appropriately capture Nathan’s particular interest in
               machine learning and artificial intelligence. While these are
               the best fit out of the Titles in the data, in reality, the
               roles chosen by Hannah or Nathan do not appear in these lists.
               This may indicate an even smaller number of hires in these
               roles and they are both roles that would likely appear on this
               list rather than a list from another profession.
            </p>
            <p>
               For this exercise roles were chosen that were more generally
               in the direction of interest, so the specificity of these titles
               is perhaps not the best data-set for considering the team’s
               prospects. As seen in Figure 1, all positions are outside of the
               top 25 Titles with Hannah the highest-ranked at 31 and Sarah C at
               77 followed by Fatima, Sarah B, and Nathan. The more generalised
               ‘Top Occupations’ list shows a more positive result and is perhaps
               the more relevant when deciding a way forward at this early stage
               in the course. Here, if a job was felt to relate to multiple
               occupations, both were included. This was to give an idea of the
               range of options/directions but the strongest match was graphed
               with a solid black line and the minor occupation a dotted line,
               See figure 2.1. But again, there was no exact match for
               Nathan’s interest in machine learning so the closest related
               occupations were used.

               <h2> Skills Analysis </h2>
               <p>
                  While this data provides useful insight into what
                  may be a fruitful addition to a curriculum vitae it
                  should be viewed more as a general guide to consider
                  which skills an individual has overall and where they
                  might be missing some opportunities. It would be
                  useful for job seekers to incorporate some of these
                  terms/skills, particularly generic skills, which they
                  may possess but may not have thought to actively include
                  in previous job applications.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Some highly ranked skills are more complimentary for many
                  jobs but would rarely be the primary skill to determine
                  eligibility, like communication skills. Some terms may
                  be interchangeable to recruiters like ‘self-motivation’
                  and ‘self-starter’ so it is difficult to ensure complete
                  coverage.  It is also worth pointing out that some of the
                  skills likely to determine job eligibility are not directly
                  matched those of the Burning Glass data, nor would some
                  implied skills be explicitly listed to feed into the Burning
                  Glass text analysis algorithms. For example, Hannah’s job
                  makes no mention of specific technologies, but would it be
                  possible to lead an Innovative Engineering and Design team
                  without a solid technical understanding? Perhaps, but
                  unlikely. However, Burning Glass’ data has proven quite
                  accurate/useful, and inclusive overall.

               <p>
                  Generic skills identified were matched with their closest terms
                  in the Burning Glass Generic Dataset (Burning Glass Technologies
                  2018d), however, some terms were only found in either the IT
                  Skills dataset or the Data_Software & Programming dataset
                  (Burning Glass Technologies 2018d) which were more generic–
                  they are denoted by an asterisk (*). Each list has been colour
                  coded by quintile so comparing across datasets for a general
                  idea about the popularity of these particular skills is still
                  useful even when the datasets vary in size.

               <h4>What are the three highest-ranked IT-specific skills which are
                   not in your required skill set (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018c)?</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li> SQL is the 1st ranked IT skill that was not included
                       in the skillset </li>
                  <li> Microsoft Windows is the 4th ranked skill which was not
                       included in the skillset.</li>
                  <li> Project Management is the 5th ranked skill not included
                       in the skillset. This would form part of these roles but was
                       included in the generic skillset.</li>
               </ol>
               <h4> What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are
                    not in your required skill set? (Burning Glass Technologies,
                    2018d) </h4>

               <ol>
                  <li> Problem-solving is the 2nd ranked Generic skill that
                       was not included in the skillset, however, it would certainly
                       be a part of all of these positions but was just not
                       articulated in the advertisements. Strategic planning would
                       involve problem-solving as well as change management and
                       project planning and development.</li>
                  <li> Troubleshooting is the 6th ranked generic skill that
                       was not included in the skillset, however, it is similar to
                       problem-solving, and elements of troubleshooting would likely
                       be a part of all these roles. </li>
                  <li> Quality Assurance and Control is the 14th ranked skill
                       that was not included in the skillset. Again, there would be
                       elements of this in these roles but it was not highlighted in
                       the job advertisements. </li>

               <h2>Members' thoughts about changing their ideal jobs</h2>
               <h4> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of
                    your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h4>
               <p> Hannah is open to the development of career goals over time.
                   Making sure to broaden the focus of skillsets acquired will
                   boost hireablility. Fluidity in thinking will maintain a
                   relevant outlook. Though the initial aim was Design Director,
                   the data shows the broader term of Technical Lead to be a
                   more available position. Keeping an eye on the requirements
                   for new job roles within IT will direct study paths and
                   ensure the current practice is forefront in learning.
                   Networking amongst like-minded peers will open channels to
                   job roles. Some of the profile tools used to develop these
                   connections and showcase skills are Slack groups, Linked In,
                   Twitter, and Blogs. Hannah is following mentor careers and
                   panels in the hope of emulating them. </p>

               <p>Nathan’s passionate interest in machine learning and
                  particularly artificial intelligence (AI) has not been
                  dampened by this analysis. Demand for machine learning in a
                  variety of industries is growing rapidly and, considering that
                  these figures are from 2018, it would not be surprising to
                  see demand for these skills already higher and growing
                  substantially over the short to medium-term. Many of the
                  skills which build the foundation for machine learning
                  projects are already in high demand, so working towards an
                  ultimate career in AI by gaining expertise in big data, data
                  engineering, programming with git and python would be a
                  practical choice with many opportunities along the way.
               </p>

               <p>Fatima’s opinion of her ideal job has not changed. She realises
                  that some of the skill set required for her ideal job as not
                  very much in demand. This is a major reason why Fatima chose to
                  complete 12 of RMIT’s subjects (from the Bachelor of IT degree)
                  alongside her actual goal of completing a Bachelor of Arts in
                  UX/UI design. She plans to choose these 12 subjects carefully,
                  keeping in mind the most in-demand skills in the IT industry.
                  Fatima expects that with the completion of these subjects, she
                  will have gained a variety of good IT and Generic skills related
                  to software development that will be of help if, and when she
                  decides to change careers.
               </p>

               <p> Sarah B has concluded that it would be sensible to broaden
                   the direction of an ideal job to focus more on software
                   development and web development rather than specifically mobile
                   application development. Remote opportunities are more readily
                   available in programming/software and including these skills
                   would increase the likelihood of better roles in the future.
                   This is also a skillset well utilised in the international
                   development space.  It would still appropriate to pursue an
                   internship or job opportunity with a company like Ionata
                   Digital, per her learning plan, as they work on a broader range
                   of products with an application development portion too. This
                   data makes it clear that communication skills are important to
                   employers across most jobs and it would be advantageous to
                   actively develop these further.
               </p>

               <p>Sarah C can see that there are limited opportunities in her
                  chosen career path, but this is not surprising as not all
                  organisations will have a CIO. If they do have a CIO, there is
                  usually only one of those roles available within an organisation
                  which aligns with why most of the skillsets for the role are
                  also not as common. As the job descriptions for the CIO role do
                  not consistently list specific technical skills, this will
                  likely be the most challenging area for Sarah to focus on. The
                  majority of the skills listed are generic skills, which also
                  make differentiation in the marketplace hard. This is a
                  long-term goal and will require consistent focus, as well as
                  continuing to revisit job descriptions to make sure her
                  development plan remains relevant and targeted.

            <article id="clouds">
               <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
               <h3>What does it do?</h3>
               <p>Cloud computing is a leading business methodology involving an
                  advancement of information technology (IT) distribution. It is
                  the amalgamation of resources, including infrastructure, storage,
                  applications and service, with scalable,
                  on-demand access given to stakeholders (Sunyaev 2020).
                  Structurally, cloud-based computing is partitioned into four main
                  areas which maintain different resources. They are equipment,
                  infrastructure, platform and application. The initial section,
                  referring to hardware, includes the physical
                  elements of storage including servers within a data centre and
                  the components, such as cables, energy and cooling systems
                  (Zhang, Chang & Boutaba 2014). There are many parts to the
                  equipment meaning data centres need masses of
                  maintenance. Worldwide, the largest data centres for cloud
                  computing belong to Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM.
                  The next level is infrastructure, otherwise known as
                  virtualisation, wherein a simulated computing environment is
                  produced. Virtualisation is a division of computing resources
                  and memory that coalesce, creating virtual environments,
                  stored on servers that share assets. Virtualisation is made
                  possible through programs such as VMware and Xem. Incorporating
                  application frameworks and operating systems is the section above
                  infrastructure, referred to as a platform.
                  The objective of the platform is to facilitate application
                  efficiency. Spearheading these sectional layers is cloud
                  applications. These comprise of software components and local
                  programs (Zhang, Chen & Boutaba 2014). These layers may
                  be classified as cloud service models.
                  Cloud service models come under three categories, Software as a
                  Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure
                  as a Service (IaaS). Despite the three cloud services being
                  different in nature, the collective aim is
                  facilitating consumers to utilise systems and programs
                  effectually. The three deployment models are public, private and
                  hybrid. (Kavis 2014)
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b>
                  <br>
                  The use of the public cloud is growing at treble the rate of
                  private cloud usage as examined by the Flexera 2020 State of the
                  Cloud Report. Cloud service is an exponentially growing field
                  with over a quarter of all tech spending used
                  on SaaS platforms in 2020 and that number projected to rise.
                  Amazon Web Services dominate the market for cloud services,
                  though all providers are showing growth. Most enterprises are
                  utilising a multi-cloud approach. The adoption of
                  cloud services, now considered the norm, and sixty percent of
                  organisations will employ cloud managed services by 2022
                  (Gartner 2019). As cloud services increase, costs regulate,
                  meaning accessibility for more end users. Therefore,
                  advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and accessible
                  scalability result in widespread capabilities and innovations.
                  Data patterns are emerging with the Internet of Things (IoT),
                  meaning the spectrum is widened with DevOps
                  automation using a central platform for testing and the
                  accumulated data has cloud-based storage. With that storage and
                  shared capability, rapid developments are emerging with Edge
                  computing. Similar advancements can be seen in the
                  fields of Blockchain, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality
                  (AR). This progression is due to cloud-based tools enabling
                  developers with abilities to test, collaborate, create and deploy
                  applications.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What can be done now?</b>
                  <br>
                  Cost reduction associated with the acquisition, management and
                  maintenance of IT systems has paved the road for creativity and
                  development of new products and services. Examples of end
                  products users have access to thanks to the cloud
                  are chatbots, social networks, communications, and business
                  management and entertainment platforms.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3
                     years)?
                  </b>
                  <br>
                  The forecast is continued growth within this sector. As it
                  becomes increasingly available, many developers will have
                  opportunities to develop new technologies and advancements in
                  AI, IoT, AR, VR and other exciting fields. Cloud
                  computing is the backbone for development. We will see an
                  adaption of a serverless model (Flexera 2020), multi-cloud
                  growth, and an increase in Edge technologies.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b>
                  <br>
                  Cloud computing has shown rapid growth with the development of
                  wireless telecommunication (Stergiou & Psannis 2017). Seamless
                  internet access provides a better cloud computing experience.
                  Furthermore, with different web-enabled gadgets
                  such as smartphones and tablets, services and storage are highly
                  accessible.
               </p>

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>With the expansion of cloud services comes many exciting and
                  varied developments within the technology field that will impact
                  daily interactions and functions as a society. Not only does it
                  save companies money, allowing them to use
                  resources to develop new technologies more rapidly, but it also
                  creates a centralised online work environment. Therefore,
                  employees can collaborate fluidly with their teams and other
                  businesses with decentralised physical workspaces.
                  The rise of remote collaboration has brought with it security
                  issues. The main security issues companies’ face with
                  cloud-based, multi-party work models are malware, phishing
                  scams, patches for old operating systems of bring your own
                  devices (BYOD) and configuration drift. To combat this, Alam
                  (2020) suggests adhering to an industry uniform set or
                  parameters offered in an open-source resource to avoid service
                  disruption. Alam (2020) also recommends Symmetric key
                  Encryption for mobile cloud computing (MCC) devices.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b>
                  <br>
                  Due to the structure of cloud computing, the responsibility of
                  security and privacy are distributable amongst providers.
                  Proportionate to the risk, consumers should expect and demand
                  expansion of Security, Transparency and Mutual Audit
                  (Ouedraogo et al. 2015). Aside from privacy and security issues,
                  cloud-based computing will impact the evolution of healthcare,
                  business, marketing, social media and the way we use everyday
                  items with IoT. Cloud computing will reach
                  nearly all aspects of our lives, specifically focussed on
                  economic and technological penetration (Vu, Hartley &
                  Kankanhalli 2020).
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b>
                  <br>
                  Groups previously unable to access resources now can do so
                  because of the global reach of cloud computing. Services
                  available online will change the lives of those who earlier
                  found education, healthcare, banking, science, agriculture,
                  work and other essentials inaccessible.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or
                     technologies?
                  </b>
                  <br>
                  Job loss due to automation is inevitable with the most vulnerable
                  positions are the entry-level services such as customer service
                  and delivery work.
               </p>

               <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
               <p>
                  <b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b>
                  <br>
                  Cloud computing has already benefited life in many ways. The
                  opportunity for remote work, creating a flexible work routine has
                  meant more time may be spent on personal pursuits resulting in
                  increased job satisfaction and productivity
                  (Felstead & Henseke 2017). Further, CC developments have meant
                  more connectivity, more capability and faster access to the web.
                  Another benefit is the access and consumption of more on-demand
                  digital products such as Netflix and
                  Spotify streaming services.
               </p>

                  <b>What will be different for you?</b>
                  <br>
                  New products and services will be accessible to consumers
                  because of pooled resources and business cost reduction. An
                  example of a more accessible product will be the release of the
                  low-cost Tesla 3 electric car. Ecommerce and
                  Mcommerce will be a more immersive and efficient customer
                  experience, thanks to the flourishing of AI technologies that
                  are improving due to cloud access.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b>
                  <br>
                  Globally, the advancements that have resulted from cloud
                  computing also mean the automation of many jobs and therefore,
                  job loss or sustained unemployment. Jobs for low skilled and
                  young workers, now progressively replaced by bots and
                  programs supported by cloud software, and even higher-level jobs,
                  like accountants and executives, are not immune from job
                  insecurity due to automation (Tang, Ma & Luo 2020). This
                  sustained job loss may lead to an unstable economy.
                  Another effect is consumption trends. Digital natives are hungry
                  for new digital experiences, and as such, demand and usage
                  increase. Platforms like Zoom and Netflix have seen exponential
                  growth during the Covid-19 pandemic and digital
                  platforms will continue to expand.
                  The continued digitisation of mobility, healthcare and
                  real-estate is imminent and this will not only affect job
                  availability and focus but also the way consumers interact with
                  these fields.

               <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

               <h3>What does it do?</h3>
               <p>
                  Cybersecurity is the process of protecting and guarding the
                  digital world against cybercrimes (Shaukat et al. 2020). Some
                  of the main categories of cybersecurity include network
                  security, application security, information security, and
                  operational security. Cybersecurity is not only crucial for
                  companies and businesses of great scale, but also for
                  individual users of the web and other digital services. With
                  the passage of time, people are relying significantly on
                  technologies and computers for a myriad of tasks. Mobile
                  banking is becoming increasingly popular, which leaves more
                  people at risk of having their financial data hacked (Oreku &
                  Mtenzi 2016). Information and communication technologies are
                  used in almost every system including financial and emergency
                  services (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016). In the present times,
                  cyberspace has become an essential factor for all fields and
                  areas and the reliance on the internet has led to increased
                  risks of malicious threats (Shaukat et al. 2020).
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now?</b>
                  <br>
                  Today, there are multiple practices through which the security
                  of a digital product or service can be ensured. Some of the
                  techniques used to prevent cyber attacks include game theory,
                  rate control, heuristics, signature-based intrusion detection,
                  autonomous systems, and end-user security controls (Zeadally
                  et al. 2020). When it comes to the implementation of these
                  practices, awareness plays a crucial role. Without an
                  understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and how to
                  deal with cyberattacks, the consequences are bound to be more
                  damaging. Currently, encryption and identity checks are the
                  most commonly used tactics for cybersecurity. Anti-virus
                  software and firewalls are used to prevent cyberattacks.
                  Businesses have prioritised cybersecurity challenges (Kaja,
                  Shaout & Ma 2019). In larger companies, where the stored
                  information may be critical and require a high level of
                  protection, cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers
                  are hired to identify and secure any surfacing vulnerability
                  within the system. However, as Skopik, Settanni and Fiedler
                  (2016, p. 154) state, 'the Internet threat landscape is
                  fundamentally changing'. The intention and objectives behind
                  cybercrimes have converted and cyberattacks are now carried
                  out in highly complex and targeted approaches that deceive the
                  average security measures (Skopik, Settanni & Fiedler 2016).
                  New technologies are rapidly being produced, with little
                  research and production of the security required to defend
                  these technologies. This leaves undetected gateways for
                  cybercriminals to enter through, leading to destructive
                  consequences for the users of the services and in some cases,
                  to the service owners and providers also (Kaja, Shaout & Ma
                  2019). As within the physical world, the digital world also
                  demands security for its users and the information stored
                  within it. Cybersecurity defence systems must be also using
                  state-of-art technologies to tackle the latest types of
                  cyberattacks.

                     developments make this possible?
                  </b>
                  <br>
                  Data and networks are significantly becoming more and more
                  sophisticated. This is an area where artificial intelligence
                  (AI) and machine learning (ML) can work better than humans to
                  provide security in the cyberspace. The use of AI and ML has
                  resulted in breakthroughs in numerous problems and can
                  certainly help in solving current and future cybersecurity
                  issues (Kaja, Shaout & Ma 2019). AI is capable of analysing
                  and inspecting large amounts of data and has proven to be an
                  effective technique for identifying false information
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). It can also 'adapt to the changing
                  nature of Internet traffic' (Zeadally et al. 2020, p. 23827)
                  This is something that would otherwise consume a lot of time.
                  Machine Learning technologies are a field of Artificial
                  Intelligence (Shaukat et al. 2020) and are currently being
                  used in cybersecurity to automate attack detections and
                  enhance their performance over time (Zeadally et al. 2020). ML
                  techniques have a crucial part in battling cyberattacks
                  including intrusion detection system, malware detection,
                  phishing detection, spam detection, and fraud detection
                  (Shaukat et al. 2020). However, some ethical issues and
                  concerns come with the involvement of AI in cybersecurity
                  (Timmers 2019). Also, the limitation that AI relies on
                  learning data that is manually processed and inspected opens
                  the possibility of inaccurate data with regard to
                  cybersecurity (Kim & Park 2020). Another issue is that
                  although ML techniques can efficiently maintain cybersecurity
                  by protecting against attacks, they are also vulnerable to
                  cyberattacks themselves and choosing the most appropriate ML
                  method so far is challenging (Shaukat et al. 2020). Also, for
                  the detection of DoS attacks, real-time detection and decision
                  making is necessary. It is not yet explored how AI can be used
                  for this purpose (Zeadally et al. 2020). Cybersecurity
                  researchers are continuing to explore the use of AI in
                  cybersecurity (Zeadally et al. 2020). It is likely that within
                  the next few years, a significant amount of cybersecurity
                  procedures will be performed with the help of AI and ML.

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b>
                  <br>
                  With the involvement of AI in cybersecurity, the process of
                  detecting a security problem and fixing it will require
                  significantly less time. The approach will focus more on
                  protecting the software or data. This is because prevention is
                  nearly impossible considering the fact that hackers would be
                  using the same technologies for performing cyberattacks
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). Companies will no longer need to hire
                  ethical hackers as this job would be carried out by AI. As
                  Braganza et al. (2020, p. 1) declare, 'Artificial intelligence
                  (AI) is challenging the foundations of businesses and changing
                  the ways people work globally'.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b>
                  <br>
                  Although AI will replace humans in cybersecurity process where mechanical and
                  analytical intelligence is required, its potential is limited
                  when it comes to areas that require intuitive and empathetic
                  intelligence (Braganza et al. 2020). Consequently, the
                  involvement of AI will not affect jobs but rather the nature
                  of the work (Braganza et al. 2020). Professionals would still
                  need to monitor the AI and ML technologies to ensure their
                  efficiency and protection. Although this development will
                  eventually replace some current cybersecurity jobs and
                  technologies, it will bring along new job opportunities such
                  as AI and ML experts who are familiar with handling the
                  AI-driven cybersecurity systems. Some of the current
                  technologies may be used in conjunction with the AI and ML
                  techniques to provide effective security systems.
               </p>

               <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
               <p>
                  <b>What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b>
                  <br>
                  With real-time detection and protection, the risks of users
                  becoming victims of ransomware will also reduce. Individual
                  home PC users would be safer from cyberattacks with the help
                  of smarter, AI-driven intrusion detection systems. People will
                  not have to do too much to ensure that their information is
                  protected in the cyberspace as the system will be doing it for
                  them. The chances of human error and slips will be
                  significantly reduced. However, users would still need to go
                  through particular procedures to ensure their security systems
                  are working properly. People who use social media or any other
                  app or service that may store any sort of personal information
                  can feel more secure and assured that their data is safe from
                  hackers. A drawback that may be faced is that people might
                  gain a 'false sense of security' and trust the AI system and
                  its decisions without actually knowing how the decision has
                  been reached (Timmers 2019). It is unrealistic to say that one
                  will be 100% secure, or that cybersecurity will be
                  unbreakable. Regardless, as use of the internet increases
                  within society, the ethical security culture would eventually
                  turn into a norm which will assist in tackling cybercrimes
                  (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016).

               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>InRecruit is a software platform that will be used by
                  organisations to improve the overall quality, consistency, and
                  inclusivity of the job descriptions they use to attract new talent.
                  The program will be used by HR teams, hiring managers, talent
                  acquisition, and anyone involved in a company’s hiring process.
                  InRecruit will provide them with an easy to navigate interface,
                  built-in curated job description libraries, critically it will
                  offer recommendations for improvement, identity potential bias,
                  and help organisations track and improve the inclusiveness of
                  their job descriptions.
               </p>
               <p>When looking to hire new staff, rarely will an organisation
                  deliberately set out to exclude entire groups within the
                  population. In fact, in the last five years, there has been an
                  increasing focus globally on diversity and inclusion in the
                  workplace. Market leaders across the IT industry have added Chief
                  Diversity Officers and Managers to their teams including Google,
                  Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Dropbox, Salesforce, and Airbnb
                  (TechRepublic, 2016). Studies by both Forbes and Harvard Business
                  School reinforce the benefits of diversity on both the innovation
                  and financial performance of organisations.
               </p>
               <q>Competition for talent is fierce in today’s global economy,
                  so companies need to have plans in place to recruit, develop,
                  and retain a diverse workforce. (Forbes, 2011)
               </q>
               <p>Understanding how to be inclusive when writing a job description
                  and applying that consistently across an organisation is the
                  challenge faced by most companies. InRecruit will help
                  organisations in their quest to attract diverse talent by
                  simplifying this critical part of the hiring process.
               </p>
               <p>Bridging the gap between recruiters and candidates, InRecruit
                  offers employers a tool to help quickly and easily build
                  inclusive job descriptions, optimised to attract the broadest
                  range of potential candidates to the organisation. With a simple
                  to use interface, recruiters can select from pre-defined fields
                  and the tool populates an inclusive job description, provides
                  suggestions and recommendations on how to improve your job
                  description, and supports approval workflows and automatic job
                  posting. Based on current best practice, whilst removing as much
                  bias as possible from the process, InRecruit reduces the workload
                  of managers, human resources (HR), and talent acquisition teams.
                  Utilising industry standards, organisational preferences and data
                  gathered through the application process the software further
                  refines and learns, to remain relevant over time.
               </p>
               <p>There are lots of tools available in the market that assist with
                  building static job descriptions. What makes InRecruit different
                  is that it has inclusivity built-in, end to end, helping
                  organisations stand out in competitive markets, and enabling them
                  to attract a broader range of candidates. The area of inclusive
                  hiring has had a lot written about it, but in terms of tools to
                  support organisations, there are very few available. When it
                  comes to key features such as analytics, benchmarking,
                  market-specific insights, and on-demand training, there are no
                  applications that can deliver all these features, as well as
                  support inclusive features such as keyword screening, bias
                  analytics, and recommendations.

                  Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent
                  more likely to have financial returns above their respective
                  national industry medians. (McKinsey, 2015)
               </q>
               <p> Forbes found that diversity in an organisation was critical to
                   global success, as well as improving innovation within a company.
                   With financial gains on the line, there is a great incentive for
                   organisations to be genuinely focused on increasing diversity.
                   Hiring diverse talent is not that simple though. One of the big
                   challenges in attracting diverse talent to an organisation is
                   known as self-screening. Self-screening is where a candidate
                   reads a job advertisement and decides that they do not meet the
                   stated criteria, education, or experience requirements and
                   therefore do not apply for the role – never allowing the employer
                   to review the candidate. This act of self-screening is much more
                   prominent in women than it is in men. Research by information
                   technology company Hewlett Packard, revealed women will not apply
                   for an advertised job role unless they believe they meet 100% of
                   the listed criteria, whereas men will apply when they meet around
                   60%. The inclusion of extraneous or over-inflated job
                   requirements is costing employers their candidates.
               </p>
               <p>To address this, organisations must utilise inclusive hiring
                  methods and standards. Job descriptions are the initial window of
                  insight into organisations and an oft lost opportunity to not
                  only find the right candidate for the role but display the
                  business’s culture. Describing the requirements of the position
                  is the point at which companies are unknowingly disconnecting
                  with potential future employees. What is said and how it is
                  worded is critical when competing for talent. In 2019 Harvard
                  Business Review researched why women do not apply for roles.
                  Their research identifies narrow job descriptions, non-inclusive
                  language, and culture as critical factors that are deterring
                  women from applying for jobs. A job description can seem like
                  such a simple thing to change, but the impact it can have on
                  hiring responses is significant. As discussed, there has been a
                  lot of research in this area around inclusive hiring, but to
                  date, no simple IT solutions for employers to implement to aid
                  them in doing this better.
               </p>
               <p>Effectively improving diversity within talent pipelines is as
                  simple as tweaking relevant job descriptions. The challenge
                  employers face is knowing which information needs changing, what
                  elements are important, and building those elements into a
                  compelling, engaging, and realistic job narrative. Most managers
                  find themselves time-poor and the recruitment function in many
                  organisations is stretched across multiple roles, offshored, or
                  using a company standard that has existed for many years. The
                  simple act of including a non-essential degree requirement, or
                  specifying that the job requires extensive travel, when in fact
                  it is not an excessive element of the role, are just two examples
                  of negative descriptors organisations add to their job
                  requirements daily, without realising the proportion of
                  candidates they have unintentionally excluded.
               </p>
               <p>The talent pool for female candidates in STEM areas such as IT is
                  already small. A 2019 research report by CUPA HR shows that in
                  the US, only 26% of students undertaking mathematical and
                  computing studies at College are female. When you add factors
                  such as ethnicity, the percentages are tiny. In Australia, the
                  Australian Bureau of Statistics (2020) has almost identical
                  figures for the percentages of women engaged in IT studies.
               </p>
               <q>Around 445,100 people were studying science, technology,
                  engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields in 2020, with 72% of
                  these students being men. (ABS, 2020)
               </q>

               <p>When the talent pool is already small, every candidate counts.
                  </br>
                  Building a software platform to enable users to rapidly build
                  highly inclusive job descriptions will immediately increase the
                  number of candidates applying for roles and give organisations
                  greater reach and diversity within the applicant pool.

                     InRecruit will enable organisations to benchmark their job
                     descriptions against the market before they release them.
                     InRecruit will have the following benchmarking capabilities:

                     <br>
                     To make InRecruit more durable, it will be built using data
                     science principles, using machine learning to provide users with
                     relevant market information, up to date language and scenarios
                     and relevant recommendations for their job descriptions. These
                     recommendations will draw upon the data gathered from InRecruit’s
                     extensive database. This will enable InRecruit to understand the
                     connections between skills, the value of those skills and their
                     scarcity within a given market. It can then provide
                     recommendations based on this information that enable managers to
                     make better informed decisions when publishing their job
                     advertisements.

                     feature to help coach users through the process of building a job
                     description, as well as being available to help them find
                     features, navigate the system, find benchmarking data, whatever
                     they need assistance with.

                  The only one of these that tends to be more specialist is the
                  Data Scientist. If InRecruit is going to remain relevant, it
                  needs to be able to learn from previous interactions so it can
                  continue to build up to date and highly inclusive job
                  descriptions.

               <p>
                  To understand whether InRecruit has market plausibility a
                  comparison of competitors that are already active within the
                  market needed to be undertaken. Conducted was research into the
                  top nine applications and software packages that are currently
                  available in the market that provide capabilities around building
                  job descriptions.
               </p>
               <p>The table below shows the competitors, as well as the categories
                  they were assessed against and where they have strengths.

               <p>
                  Our assessment showed six key features that either are not
                  available in existing applications, or only available in a small
                  number of applications. These features are:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Bias analysis and accessibility scoring (three applications
                      have this functionality)
                  </li>
                  <li>The use of AI and data science to curate content and make
                      recommendations (two applications have this functionality)
                  </li>
                  <li>Benchmarking (two applications have this functionality)</li>
                  <li>On demand accessibility training (no applications have this
                      functionality)
                  </li>
                  <li>Market specific job descriptions (no applications have this
                      functionality)
