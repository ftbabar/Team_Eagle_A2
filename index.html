         <h3>Fatima Babar</h3>
         <p>
            Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
            Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in Pakistan
            with her family and grandparents. Being a dual nationality
            holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu fluently, and has
            also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has recently completed
            Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to complete a Bachelor of
            Arts degree (Majoring in Digital Experience and Interaction
            design) within the next 3 years. Fatima’s interest in IT
            developed with the efforts of her father, a software
            developer, who was always convincing her to follow his lead
            into becoming a software developer too. However, it wasn’t
            until her father started a remote job that Fatima actually
            started to take interest in this field. Due to her love for
            art and design, she has now decided to become a digital
            designer and is studying hard for achieving her goal. Fatima
            has no prior experience in the IT field except for learning
            the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design essential skills
            from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to become a successful
            digital designer and travel the world. In her free time,
            Fatima enjoys baking and decorating cakes, doing some DIY
            decor, and is always looking forward to the summer holidays
            season in which she enjoys travelling with family and cousins.

         <h3>Hannah Smith</h3>
         <p>
            Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently live on
            Sydney’s Northern Beaches. She graduated high school in 1999,
            then, after studying film in college, she moved to New Zealand
            for five years, where she opened a retail store. After moving
            back to Australia in 2007, Hannah ran an online wholesale and
            retail business for twelve years before deciding to pivot her
            career and is now studying IT at RMIT University. Currently,
            she is working as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for
            an online retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with
            her family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
            board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah believes
            that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when researching
            fast-paced developments and technologies. Due to the
            coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to look
            deeper into the information technology field, quickly
            realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but rapidly
            changing the way we live and work in all industries. Initially
            being drawn to design because of her creative background, she
            started to look into user experience and user interaction
            (UX/UI), fields which excite her. After researching the impact
            of digital monitoring technologies on the Australian populace,
            she also became very engrossed with the development and ethics
            of new technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience
            including relational skills, small business, strategic
            planning, along with design competence. She is also familiar
            with the Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and
            online communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
            Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

         <p>
            Sarah is someone who is very passionate about global
            development issues which led her to first work in Tonga in
            2014, where she met her now husband. She lives on a working
            vineyard in the Coal River Valley, Tasmania, with her
            2-year-old daughter and 1 year-old son and enjoys foraging for
            sloe berries in late summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both
            Australian and Tongan nationality and can speak both
            languages. She owns a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
            Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and Technology
            (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor’s degree in IT.
            Sarah had always been curious about how computers/networking
            worked. But after recognising the power IT has when it comes
            to developing for the good of people, her determination led
            her to learn about the IT solutions for microfinance and
            remittances which further sparked her interest in the link
            between development and IT. Despite not having previous IT
            experience, Sarah has always had incredible written and verbal
            communication skills that have further improved throughout her
            18 years of working in roles where these skills were used
            daily with a variety of stakeholders. She holds a genuine
            interest in constantly learning and behaves in a way
            consistent with CleverTech’s culture; being respectful,
            collaborative, and introspective by nature.

         <h3>Sarah Carney</h3>
         <p>
            Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah owns dual
            citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone who
            strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees in
            Science, Marketing, an MBA and is now adding IT to the
            collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The
            idea behind it is that you create something and leave it
            somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy
            to their day. Sarah has always loved technology, but had never
            understood IT, the careers it offered or the industry in
            general. She had spent a lot of her career working in law and
            overseas and on returning to Australia, she took the
            opportunity to try out a new industry - telecommunications.
            Over time, she moved into a project role, and that was her
            first real exposure to what is possible with IT. She learned
            about EPICs, features, user stories and wire frames, a whole
            world she had never known existed. Sarah was hooked.
            Naturally, when a friend reached out and asked if she would be
            interested in joining Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and
            there, she has found her home. Sarah has worked in management
            roles for a number of years, across a few different
            industries. As a result, she has multiple skills and
            experiences which include:

      <h2>IT Work</h2>
      <div class="JessInterview">
         <h3>Jess Dodson - Customer Engineer (Microsoft)</h3>

         <p></p>
         <h4>The job</h4>
         <p>
            Jess is in her second year of working for Microsoft as a
            Customer Engineer. Having previously worked as a System
            Administrator, Jess has expertise in the area of security,
            which is what she now predominantly specialises in. The main
            focus of her current role is to support her customers in their
            use, understanding and application of their Microsoft
            technology investments. For Jess, this means the majority of
            her time is spent with customers teaching, sharing,
            demonstrating and troubleshooting.
         </p>

         <p>
            With a background in government and higher education, these
            tend to be the industries and customers she supports in her
            work for Microsoft. Within these industries she observed that
            "IT is seen as a cost sink" and that IT teams are always
            trying to find ways of doing more with less and operating with
            very lean teams. Throughout COVID Jess has seen a huge shift
            in focus in these industries towards security. With the
            increase in remote working and BYOD trends, identity,
            authentication and end to end security conversations are her
            core focus.
         </p>
         <h4>The activities</h4>
         <p>
            A typical day for a Customer Engineer depends on whether they
            are scheduled to be with a customer or not. On a customer
            facing day, typical activities include triaging email, seeing
            what has come in overnight, preparing for the customer
            presentation and checking any demo environments. It isn't
            unusual for Jess to spend 6 - 10 hours on any given day in
            Teams voice or video chats with customers - whether that is
            teaching them something new, doing a demo, running an
            assessment on existing deployments and infrastructure or
            helping lead them through building something new in a lab or
            their own environment. On average, Jess estimates she spends
            75% - 80% of her time working directly with customers. She
            considers herself to be a technical translator. To be
            successful in her role, she needs to find ways of explaining
            sometimes complex technical jargon and concepts in simple,
            easy to consume ways. Her audiences can be anyone from the
            helpdesk team to the CEO, which requires an aptitude for
            understanding the audience and delivering a message they can
            relate to or understand.
            <br/>
            On days without customers, Jess focuses her time on technical
            training and upskilling. Keeping current with the technology
            she is delivering is critical. She is the face of Microsoft
            into that customer and is often expected to know a lot about a
            broad range of subjects. Jess actively sets aside time to make
            sure she is up to date on product changes, proposed features,
            as well as understanding what competitors are doing with their
            products.
            <br/>
            Jess regularly contributes to podcasts, interviews,
            conferences and other speaking engagements. She is a sought
            after presenter and dedicates additional time to building her
            content for these sessions.
         </p>
         <p>A typical week for Jess could look something like this:</p>

         <img
            src="working-week.png"
            alt="Image of calendar"
            width="500"
            height="200"
         />

         <p>Jess faces two main challenges in her role:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               Interaction. Currently Jess is required to deliver all her
               work remotely. Hosting deeply technical calls with up to 25
               people at a time, who are also all working remotely,
               creates a real challenge in building a rapport, creating
               personal engagement and driving interaction. For sessions
               that can span multiple days, this is a real challenge when
               trying to help customers get the most out of their
               experience, at the same time as gauging whether the
               material is pitched at the right level and people are all
               following what is happening.
            </li>
            <li>
               Articulating the why. The second challenge Jess faces is
               articulating why customers should do what it is she is
               recommending they do. With a lot of the assessments that
               Jess does, there are usually recommendations or changes
               that need to be made, some of which will have a financial
               impact for an organisation. Jess must find ways of
               delivering her reports or findings in a compelling manner
               that enables the customer to take those recommendations
               forward and sell them to their own internal stakeholders.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            Jess's most valuable technical skills at the moment relate to
            security. She has skills across Azure IaaS which she leverages
            on a weekly basis, but it is security tools and Azure Sentinel
            and conversations about Security Incident and Event Management
            (SIEM) specifically that are in the highest demand.
            <br/>
            When taking on the Customer Engineer role, Jess was surprised
            to find that Executive Presence was a skill she needed on an
            almost daily basis. Often, she isn't talking to just other
            technical professionals, but to business owners, investors and
            C-level executives. This requires her to be compelling and
            able to demonstrate great presence.
         </p>
         <h4>The interactions</h4>
         <p>
            When working with customers, the following are the kinds of
            roles Jess finds herself interacting with:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Security analysts</li>
            <li>System admins</li>
            <li>Infrastructure engineers</li>
            <li>Network engineers</li>
            <li>CIO</li>
            <li>CISO</li>
            <li>CEO</li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            These interactions can vary across information gathering,
            delivering technical training, providing a demonstration, or
            presenting the outcome of an assessment. Given the broad range
            of work that Jess delivers, it is unsurprising that she
            interacts with such a broad range of roles whilst working with
            customers.
            <br/>
            At Microsoft, Jess has a second set of internal stakeholders
            that she interacts with each week. These include:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Account Managers - as they "own" the customer relationships
               and can share key information about the customer itself
               such as internal structures, who the main stakeholders are,
               and any current work being done with the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
               Cloud Solution Architects - who might also be working with
               the same customer and delivering POC engagements or other
               related technical activities.
            </li>
            <li>
               Account Technology Strategists - work with customers to
               support the development of their ongoing digital strategy,
               including demonstrating new technology as it is released.
               Jess needs to know what is being shared or shown to the
               customer, so her presentations are aligned.

               Account Executive - the Account Executive owns the sales
               strategy for a particular customer and Jess will work with
               them to understand what is currently planned or can share
               any insights she gains from the work she does for them.
            </li>
            <li>
               Her manager - Jess has a manager who supports a group of
               Customer Engineers and is there to assist Jess with any
               challenges she is facing, help her build and execute on her
               personal development plan and provide coaching to help her
               growth.

            The final, and perhaps most significant group of people that
            Jess interacts with internally are other Customer Engineers.
            Through Teams channels and distribution lists she and her
            fellow Customer Engineers form a strong support network. As a
            group they are able to share ideas, updates on product
            changes, but perhaps most importantly, they provide a valuable
            source of information to each other. No one person could
            possibly know the depth and breadth of all products developed
            by Microsoft, but the team of engineers are able to support
            each other and find the answers quickly to almost any customer
            challenge. Jess has actively cultivated her network to help
            her be more able to support her customers when they have
            questions she doesn't have an immediate answer to.

         <h4>In closing</h4>
         <p>
            When asked about an example of the work she does that best
            captures the essence of the IT industry, Jess shared an
            example of a Government customer she has been working with
            over a long period of time. The customer has multitudes of
            Microsoft products that were previously unused or
            under-utilised. Often in her role, interactions are one off,
            or single days. With this customer, Jess has been back four
            times now. What has happened over this time is that she has
            been able to assist them with increasing and building their
            confidence with using their products. She has seen incredible
            growth and learning from them as they have moved towards
            greater technical maturity as an organisation. Jess feels that
            IT is all about learning. The rate of change and innovation is
            so high in this industry, you have to keep up or get left
            behind, "If you don't like learning, you are going to be in
            the wrong job".
