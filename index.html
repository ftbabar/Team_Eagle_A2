                  <p>
                     Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently
                     lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high
                     school in 1999, then, after studying film in college, she
                     moved to New Zealand for five years, where she opened a
                     retail store. After moving back to Australia in 2007,
                     Hannah ran an online wholesale and retail business for
                     twelve years before deciding to pivot her career and is now
                     studying IT at RMIT University. Currently, she is working
                     as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for an online
                     retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with her
                     family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
                     board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah
                     believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when
                     researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                     to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                     look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                     realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but
                     rapidly changing the way we live and work in all
                     industries. Initially being drawn to design because of her
                     creative background, she started to investigate the user
                     experience and user interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite
                     her. After researching the impact of digital monitoring
                     technologies on the Australian populace, she also became
                     very engrossed with the development and ethics of modern
                     technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience including
                     relational skills, small business, strategic planning, as
                     well as design competence. She is also familiar with the
                     Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and online
                     communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
                     Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

                  <p>
                     Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                     Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in
                     Pakistan with her family and grandparents. Being a dual
                     nationality holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu
                     fluently and has also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has
                     recently completed Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to
                     complete a Bachelor of Arts degree (Majoring in Digital
                     Experience and Interaction design) within the next 3 years.
                     Fatima's interest in IT developed with the efforts of her
                     father, a software developer, who was always convincing her
                     to follow his lead into becoming a software developer too.
                     However, it wasn't until her father started a remote job
                     that Fatima started to take interest in this field. Due to
                     her love for art and design, she has now decided to become
                     a digital designer and is studying hard to achieve her
                     goal. Fatima has no prior experience in the IT field except
                     for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design
                     essential skills from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to
                     become a successful digital designer and travel the world.
                     In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking and decorating
                     cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always looking forward
                     to the summer holidays season in which she enjoys
                     travelling with family and cousins.

                     Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                     35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being
                     Portra 400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and
                     learning something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a
                     kid when he got his first family computer. He was always on
                     it, mostly playing games at that age. It grew from there
                     when Nathan became more interested in what his dad was
                     doing as he was an IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan
                     enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so he could
                     follow in his dad's footsteps. He has now been working in
                     IT for the last ten years across four different jobs and
                     has spent the last nine years on two separate support
                     desks. This has given him relevant experience in IT and
                     good exposure to different technologies. Nathan's current
                     job has given him more experience in software development,
                     which is where he sees his career going. Nathan brings many
                     skills to the team. Some of his skills and qualifications
                     (apart from being a GitHub master!) are:

                  <p>
                     Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has
                     dual citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone
                     who strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees
                     in Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                     collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art".
                     The concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                     somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some
                     joy to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had
                     never deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the
                     industry in general. She had spent a lot of her career
                     working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia,
                     she took the opportunity to try out a new industry -
                     telecommunications. Over time, she moved into a project
                     role, and that was her first real exposure to what is
                     possible with IT. She learned about EPICs, features, user
                     stories, and wireframes, an entire world she had never
                     known existed. Sarah was hooked. Naturally, when a friend
                     reached out and asked if she would be interested in joining
                     Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and there, she has found
                     her home. Sarah has worked in management roles for several
                     years, across a few different industries. As a result, she
                     has multiple skills and experiences which include:

                  <p>
                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.
