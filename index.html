                  <p>
                     Hannah was born and grew up in Australia and currently
                     lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She graduated high
                     school in 1999, then, after studying film in college, she
                     moved to New Zealand for five years, where she opened a
                     retail store. After moving back to Australia in 2007,
                     Hannah ran an online wholesale and retail business for
                     twelve years before deciding to pivot her career and is now
                     studying IT at RMIT University. Currently, she is working
                     as a digital designer and eCommerce manager for an online
                     retail business. She enjoys spending weekends with her
                     family and paddle-boarding on the lake after winning a SUP
                     board in a -fifty words or less- competition. Hannah
                     believes that it is hard not to become engrossed in IT when
                     researching fast-paced developments and technologies. Due
                     to the coronavirus, she was staying at home and decided to
                     look deeper into the information technology field, quickly
                     realising that IT is not only ingrained in society but
                     rapidly changing the way we live and work in all
                     industries. Initially being drawn to design because of her
                     creative background, she started to investigate the user
                     experience and user interaction (UX/UI) fields which excite
                     her. After researching the impact of digital monitoring
                     technologies on the Australian populace, she also became
                     very engrossed with the development and ethics of modern
                     technologies. Hannah has previous IT experience including
                     relational skills, small business, strategic planning, as
                     well as design competence. She is also familiar with the
                     Office Suite, some of the Adobe design platforms and online
                     communication and sharing tools like Slack, Microsoft
                     Teams, Gmail, and Dropbox.

                     Fatima is the youngest member on the team. She is an
                     Australian Pakistani girl who is currently living in
                     Pakistan with her family and grandparents. Being a dual
                     nationality holder, Fatima speaks both English and Urdu
                     fluently and has also learnt the basics of Arabic. She has
                     recently completed Cambridge A levels and is now aiming to
                     complete a Bachelor of Arts degree (Majoring in Digital

                     Fatima's interest in IT developed with the efforts of her
                     father, a software developer, who was always convincing her
                     to follow his lead into becoming a software developer too.
                     However, it wasn't until her father started a remote job
                     that Fatima started to take interest in this field. Due to
                     her love for art and design, she has now decided to become
                     a digital designer and is studying hard to achieve her
                     goal. Fatima has no prior experience in the IT field except
                     for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and graphic design
                     essential skills from LinkedIn Learning. Her dream is to
                     become a successful digital designer and travel the world.
                     In her free time, Fatima enjoys baking and decorating
                     cakes, doing some DIY decor, and is always looking forward
                     to the summer holidays season in which she enjoys
                     travelling with family and cousins.

                     Nathan enjoys photography and mostly shoots film. He shoots
                     35mm and medium format, with his favourite film being
                     Portra 400. He also enjoys playing games, writing code, and
                     learning something new. Nathan's interest in IT began as a
                     kid when he got his first family computer. He was always on
                     it, mostly playing games at that age. It grew from there
                     when Nathan became more interested in what his dad was
                     doing as he was an IT engineer. When he left school, Nathan
                     enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so he could
                     follow in his dad's footsteps. He has now been working in
                     IT for the last ten years across four different jobs and
                     has spent the last nine years on two separate support
                     desks. This has given him relevant experience in IT and
                     good exposure to different technologies. Nathan's current
                     job has given him more experience in software development,
                     which is where he sees his career going. Nathan brings many
                     skills to the team. Some of his skills and qualification

                  <p>
                     Born in Australia, but with a British mother, Sarah has
                     dual citizenship. She is an inspiring person and someone
                     who strongly believes in lifelong learning. She has degrees
                     in Science, Marketing, an MBA, and is now adding IT to the
                     collection! Her current hobby is known as "abandoned art".
                     The concept is that atrists create something and leave it
                     somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some
                     joy to their day. Sarah has always loved technology but had
                     never deeply understood IT, the careers it offered or the
                     industry in general. She had spent a lot of her career
                     working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia,
                     she took the opportunity to try out a new industry -
                     telecommunications. Over time, she moved into a project
                     role, and that was her first real exposure to what is
                     possible with IT. She learned about EPICs, features, user
                     stories, and wireframes, an entire world she had never
                     known existed. Sarah was hooked. Naturally, when a friend
                     reached out and asked if she would be interested in joining
                     Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and there, she has found
                     her home. Sarah has worked in management roles for several
                     years, across a few different industries. As a result, she
                     has multiple skills and experiences which include:

                  <p>
                     Sarah is deeply passionate about global development issues
                     which led her to work in Tonga in 2014, where she met her
                     now-husband. She lives on a working vineyard in the Coal
                     River Valley, Tasmania, with her 2-year-old daughter and
                     1-year-old son and enjoys foraging for sloe berries in late
                     summer to make sloe gin. Sarah has both Australian and
                     Tongan nationality and can speak both languages. She
                     already has a Certificate III in Business (2003), a
                     Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and
                     Technology (2020), and is now working towards a bachelor's
                     degree in IT. Sarah had always been curious about how
                     computers/networking worked. After recognising the power IT
                     has when it comes to developing countries and communities,
                     her determination led her to learn about IT solutions for
                     microfinance and remittances which further sparked her
                     interest in the link between development and IT. Despite
                     not having previous IT experience, Sarah has always had
                     incredible written and verbal communication skills that
                     have further improved throughout her 18 years of working in
                     roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of
                     stakeholders. She has a genuine interest in constantly
                     learning and behaves in a way consistent with CleverTech's
                     culture; being respectful, collaborative, and introspective
                     by nature.

               <h2>Online Test Outcomes</h2>
               <p>
                  Our group is well-balanced when it comes to the members'
                  personality traits. When working in a team, it is always
                  beneficial to have people that vary in the way they understand
                  and do things. One thing that we all have in common is the way
                  we cope with our emotions and make decisions. According to the
                  Myers Brigg results, all members rely on feeling rather than
                  thinking and think for the well-fare of others. Our main
                  question is: "who does this help?". This is evident within our
                  individual project ideas from assignment 1. When it comes to
                  our learning styles, the results also vary. Some members learn
                  better by reading and writing while others by listening,
                  speaking, or trying.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This information is definitely very helpful for the group. To
                  have effective communication with a positive outcome, one must
                  first understand who they are communicating with, and what
                  might be the best way to convey a message to them. By viewing
                  each other's test results, we can better make use of the
                  skills and traits each member brings with them. We will know
                  who may be the best one for a particular task and how to help
                  or give feedback to another member when needed. Not only does
                  this help other members, but every individual can also realise
                  their own weaknesses and work to overcome them in ways which
                  suit them the best. The result: Hopefully a very successful
                  and happy team!

                  more technically focused roles such as the path of a

                  Designer, a Mobile Developer, and a Full Stack Machine
                  Learning Engineer. This variation is not surprising given the
                  different life and career stages each member of the team is

                  Most of the team plan to complete the Bachelor of Information
                  Technology degree with RMIT, but that is where our career
                  plans diverge. Some are looking at internships, during the
                  period of the degree, to gain experience before exploring a
                  role that will take them a step closer to their ideal job.
                  Others are looking at moving directly into their first paying

                  One member of the team has gone a step further with their

                  other courses and programs along with industry certifications.
                  Across the three years, broadening their technical knowledge

               <p>
                  To conclude, this comparison shows, while most of our group
                  are aiming to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology
                  degree, there will be different outcomes and career
                  trajectories. The collective ideal jobs, whilst having some
                  similar skills and responsibilities, are all different.

               <h2>Group Members' Ideal Jobs</h2>
               <h4>
                  What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do
                  each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?
               </h4>

               <p>
                  Technical Lead was chosen for Hannah’s Burning Glass Match
                  because her role would involve leading a large team of
                  technical experts and was the closest fit. Big Data Engineer
                  was chosen for Nathan as big data is usually associated with
                  machine learning algorithms and this was the closest fit.
                  ‘Full Stack Engineer’ did not appropriately capture Nathan’s
                  particular interest in machine learning and artificial
                  intelligence. While these are the best fit out of the Titles
                  in the data, in reality, the roles chosen by Hannah or Nathan
                  do not appear in these lists. This may indicate an even
                  smaller number of hires in these roles and they are both roles
                  that would likely appear on this list rather than a list from
                  another profession.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For this exercise roles were chosen that were more generally
                  in the direction of interest, so the specificity of these
                  titles is perhaps not the best data-set for considering the
                  team’s prospects. As seen in Figure 1, all positions are
                  outside of the top 25 Titles with Hannah the highest-ranked at
                  31 and Sarah C at 77 followed by Fatima, Sarah B, and Nathan.
                  The more generalised ‘Top Occupations’ list shows a more
                  positive result and is perhaps the more relevant when deciding
                  a way forward at this early stage in the course. Here, if a
                  job was felt to relate to multiple occupations, both were
                  included. This was to give an idea of the range of
                  options/directions but the strongest match was graphed with a
                  solid black line and the minor occupation a dotted line, See
                  figure 2.1. But again, there was no exact match for Nathan’s
                  interest in machine learning so the closest related
                  occupations were used.

               <h2>Skills Analysis</h2>
               <p>
                  While this data provides useful insight into what may be a
                  fruitful addition to a curriculum vitae it should be viewed
                  more as a general guide to consider which skills an individual
                  has overall and where they might be missing some
                  opportunities. It would be useful for job seekers to
                  incorporate some of these terms/skills, particularly generic
                  skills, which they may possess but may not have thought to
                  actively include in previous job applications.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Some highly ranked skills are more complimentary for many jobs
                  but would rarely be the primary skill to determine
                  eligibility, like communication skills. Some terms may be
                  interchangeable to recruiters like ‘self-motivation’ and
                  ‘self-starter’ so it is difficult to ensure complete coverage.
                  It is also worth pointing out that some of the skills likely
                  to determine job eligibility are not directly matched those of
                  the Burning Glass data, nor would some implied skills be
                  explicitly listed to feed into the Burning Glass text analysis
                  algorithms. For example, Hannah’s job makes no mention of
                  specific technologies, but would it be possible to lead an
                  Innovative Engineering and Design team without a solid
                  technical understanding? Perhaps, but unlikely. However,
                  Burning Glass’ data has proven quite accurate/useful, and
                  inclusive overall.
               </p>
               <h3>General skills</h3>
               <h4>
                  How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in
                  terms of demand from employers?
               </h4>
               <p>
                  Generic skills identified were matched with their closest
                  terms in the Burning Glass Generic Dataset (Burning Glass
                  Technologies 2018d), however, some terms were only found in
                  either the IT Skills dataset or the Data_Software &
                  Programming dataset (Burning Glass Technologies 2018d) which
                  were more generic– they are denoted by an asterisk (*). Each
                  list has been colour coded by quintile so comparing across
                  datasets for a general idea about the popularity of these
                  particular skills is still useful even when the datasets vary
                  in size.

                     Project Management is the 5th ranked skill not included in
                     the skillset. This would form part of these roles but was
                     included in the generic skillset.

                     be a part of all of these positions but was just not
                     articulated in the advertisements. Strategic planning would

                     Troubleshooting is the 6th ranked generic skill that was
                     not included in the skillset, however, it is similar to
                     problem-solving, and elements of troubleshooting would
                     likely be a part of all these roles.

                  <li>
                     Quality Assurance and Control is the 14th ranked skill that
                     was not included in the skillset. Again, there would be
                     elements of this in these roles but it was not highlighted
                     in the job advertisements.

                  Hannah is open to the development of career goals over time.
                  Making sure to broaden the focus of skillsets acquired will
                  boost hireablility. Fluidity in thinking will maintain a
                  relevant outlook. Though the initial aim was Design Director,
                  the data shows the broader term of Technical Lead to be a more
                  available position. Keeping an eye on the requirements for new
                  job roles within IT will direct study paths and ensure the
                  current practice is forefront in learning. Networking amongst
                  like-minded peers will open channels to job roles. Some of the
                  profile tools used to develop these connections and showcase
                  skills are Slack groups, Linked In, Twitter, and Blogs. Hannah
                  is following mentor careers and panels in the hope of

                  Nathan’s passionate interest in machine learning and
                  particularly artificial intelligence (AI) has not been
                  dampened by this analysis. Demand for machine learning in a
                  variety of industries is growing rapidly and, considering that
                  these figures are from 2018, it would not be surprising to see
                  demand for these skills already higher and growing
                  substantially over the short to medium-term. Many of the
                  skills which build the foundation for machine learning
                  projects are already in high demand, so working towards an
                  ultimate career in AI by gaining expertise in big data, data
                  engineering, programming with git and python would be a
                  practical choice with many opportunities along the way.

                  Fatima’s opinion of her ideal job has not changed. She
                  realises that some of the skill set required for her ideal job
                  as not very much in demand. This is a major reason why Fatima
                  chose to complete 12 of RMIT’s subjects (from the Bachelor of
                  IT degree) alongside her actual goal of completing a Bachelor
                  of Arts in UX/UI design. She plans to choose these 12 subjects
                  carefully, keeping in mind the most in-demand skills in the IT
                  industry. Fatima expects that with the completion of these
                  subjects, she will have gained a variety of good IT and
                  Generic skills related to software development that will be of
                  help if, and when she decides to change careers.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Sarah B has concluded that it would be sensible to broaden the
                  direction of an ideal job to focus more on software
                  development and web development rather than specifically
                  mobile application development. Remote opportunities are more
                  readily available in programming/software and including these
                  skills would increase the likelihood of better roles in the
                  future. This is also a skillset well utilised in the
                  international development space. It would still appropriate to
                  pursue an internship or job opportunity with a company like
                  Ionata Digital, per her learning plan, as they work on a
                  broader range of products with an application development
                  portion too. This data makes it clear that communication
                  skills are important to employers across most jobs and it
                  would be advantageous to actively develop these further.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Sarah C can see that there are limited opportunities in her
                  chosen career path, but this is not surprising as not all
                  organisations will have a CIO. If they do have a CIO, there is
                  usually only one of those roles available within an
                  organisation which aligns with why most of the skillsets for
                  the role are also not as common. As the job descriptions for
                  the CIO role do not consistently list specific technical
                  skills, this will likely be the most challenging area for
                  Sarah to focus on. The majority of the skills listed are
                  generic skills, which also make differentiation in the
                  marketplace hard. This is a long-term goal and will require
                  consistent focus, as well as continuing to revisit job
                  descriptions to make sure her development plan remains
                  relevant and targeted.

            <h2>Jess Dodson - Customer Engineer (Microsoft)</h2>
            <article id="jess-dodson-job">
               <h3>The job</h3>
               <p>
                  Jess is in her second year of working for Microsoft as a
                  Customer Engineer. Jess’s love of IT started at a young age
                  and was encouraged by her father who was a System Engineer.
                  She found she always loved computers and selected numerous IT
                  subjects to pursue when she started High School. Jess
                  unfortunately didn’t achieve the results she had hoped to on
                  leaving school and took a six month break before she returned
                  to IT. Jess enrolled initially for a Certificate IV, and then
                  Diploma in Network Engineering. With this knowledge, she
                  started a role on an IT Help Desk, while she studied for her
                  Bachelor of IT. When asked about what was most valuable out of
                  her studies, Jess felt that the technical skills dated
                  quickly, but that university had taught her how to learn,
                  which she finds critical in her current role.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Having previously worked as a System Administrator, Jess has
                  expertise in the area of security, which is what she now
                  predominantly specialises in. The main focus of her current
                  role is to support her customers in their use, understanding
                  and application of their Microsoft technology investments. For
                  Jess, this means the majority of her time is spent with
                  customers teaching, sharing, demonstrating and
                  troubleshooting.
               </p>
               <p>
                  With a background in government and higher education, these
                  tend to be the industries and customers she supports in her
                  work for Microsoft. Within these industries she observed that
                  "IT is seen as a cost sink" and that IT teams are always
                  trying to find ways of doing more with less and operating with
                  very lean teams. Throughout COVID Jess has seen a huge shift
                  in focus in these industries towards security. With the
                  increase in remote working and BYOD trends, identity,
                  authentication and end to end security conversations are her
                  core focus.

            <article id="jess-dodson-activities">
               <h3>The activities</h3>
               <p>
                  A typical day for a Customer Engineer depends on whether they
                  are scheduled to be with a customer or not. On a customer
                  facing day, typical activities include triaging email, seeing
                  what has come in overnight, preparing for the customer
                  presentation and checking any demo environments. It isn't
                  unusual for Jess to spend 6 - 10 hours on any given day in
                  Teams voice or video chats with customers - whether that is
                  teaching them something new, doing a demo, running an
                  assessment on existing deployments and infrastructure or
                  helping lead them through building something new in a lab or
                  their own environment. On average, Jess estimates she spends
                  75% - 80% of her time working directly with customers. She
                  considers herself to be a technical translator. To be
                  successful in her role, she needs to find ways of explaining
                  sometimes complex technical jargon and concepts in simple,
                  easy to consume ways. Her audiences can be anyone from the
                  helpdesk team to the CEO, which requires an aptitude for
                  understanding the audience and delivering a message they can
                  relate to or understand.
               </p>
               <p>
                  On days without customers, Jess focuses her time on technical
                  training and upskilling. Keeping current with the technology
                  she is delivering is critical. She is the face of Microsoft
                  into that customer and is often expected to know a lot about a
                  broad range of subjects. Jess actively sets aside time to make
                  sure she is up to date on product changes, proposed features,
                  as well as understanding what competitors are doing with their
                  products.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Jess regularly contributes to podcasts, interviews,
                  conferences and other speaking engagements. She is a sought
                  after presenter and dedicates additional time to building her
                  content for these sessions.
               </p>

               <p>A typical week for Jess could look something like this:</p>

               <img
                  src="images/working-week.png"
                  alt="Image of calendar"
                  width="100%"
               />

               <p>Jess faces two main challenges in her role:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Interaction. Currently Jess is required to deliver all her
                     work remotely. Hosting deeply technical calls with up to 25
                     people at a time, who are also all working remotely,
                     creates a real challenge in building a rapport, creating
                     personal engagement and driving interaction. For sessions
                     that can span multiple days, this is a real challenge when
                     trying to help customers get the most out of their
                     experience, at the same time as gauging whether the
                     material is pitched at the right level and people are all
                     following what is happening.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Articulating the why. The second challenge Jess faces is
                     articulating why customers should do what it is she is
                     recommending they do. With a lot of the assessments that
                     Jess does, there are usually recommendations or changes
                     that need to be made, some of which will have a financial
                     impact for an organisation. Jess must find ways of
                     delivering her reports or findings in a compelling manner
                     that enables the customer to take those recommendations
                     forward and sell them to their own internal stakeholders.
                  </li>
               </ol>

               <p>
                  Jess's most valuable technical skills at the moment relate to
                  security. She has skills across Azure IaaS which she leverages
                  on a weekly basis, but it is security tools and Azure Sentinel
                  and conversations about Security Incident and Event Management
                  (SIEM) specifically that are in the highest demand.
               </p>

               <p>
                  When taking on the Customer Engineer role, Jess was surprised
                  to find that Executive Presence was a skill she needed on an
                  almost daily basis. Often, she isn't talking to just other
                  technical professionals, but to business owners, investors and
                  C-level executives. This requires her to be compelling and
                  able to demonstrate great presence.
               </p>

               <p>
                  One of her favourite things about working in IT is that it is
                  ever changing. She enjoys the rapid pace of change and the
                  fact that she can never be sure what she will be working on in
                  the coming years.
               </p>
            </article>

            <article id="jess-dodson-interactions">
               <h3>The interactions</h3>

               <p>
                  When working with customers, the following are the kinds of
                  roles Jess finds herself interacting with:
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Security analysts</li>
                  <li>System admins</li>
                  <li>Infrastructure engineers</li>
                  <li>Network engineers</li>
                  <li>CIO</li>
                  <li>CISO</li>
                  <li>CEO</li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  These interactions can vary across information gathering,
                  delivering technical training, providing a demonstration, or
                  presenting the outcome of an assessment. Given the broad range
                  of work that Jess delivers, it is unsurprising that she
                  interacts with such a broad range of roles whilst working with
                  customers.
               </p>

               <p>
                  At Microsoft, Jess has a second set of internal stakeholders
                  that she interacts with each week. These include:
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>
                     Account Managers - as they "own" the customer relationships
                     and can share key information about the customer itself
                     such as internal structures, who the main stakeholders are,
                     and any current work being done with the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Cloud Solution Architects - who might also be working with
                     the same customer and delivering POC engagements or other
                     related technical activities.

                     Account Executive - the Account Executive owns the sales
                     strategy for a particular customer and Jess will work with
                     them to understand what is currently planned or can share
                     any insights she gains from the work she does for them.

                     Her manager - Jess has a manager who supports a group of
                     Customer Engineers and is there to assist Jess with any
                     challenges she is facing, help her build and execute on her
                     personal development plan and provide coaching to help her
                     growth.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  The final, and perhaps most significant group of people that
                  Jess interacts with internally are other Customer Engineers.
                  Through Teams channels and distribution lists she and her
                  fellow Customer Engineers form a strong support network. As a
                  group they are able to share ideas, updates on product
                  changes, but perhaps most importantly, they provide a valuable
                  source of information to each other. No one person could
                  possibly know the depth and breadth of all products developed
                  by Microsoft, but the team of engineers are able to support
                  each other and find the answers quickly to almost any customer
                  challenge. Jess has actively cultivated her network to help
                  her be more able to support her customers when they have
                  questions she doesn't have an immediate answer to.

               <h3>Thoughts on Team Eagle's Project</h3>

               <p>
                  Jess is passionate about Diversity and Inclusion and speaks
                  publicly on the subject. She loved the idea of the project
                  that Team Eagle is pursuing and stated that she wished more
                  organisations had a tool like it. She could easily see the
                  potential application of IT in this space and identified some
                  of the elements that would help make it successful such as
                  Machine Learning and AI capabilities. On discussing potential
                  challenges, she flagged that she thought that defining the
                  parameters for inclusion could be the hardest part for the
                  team. Jess highlighted that what makes an inclusive job
                  description can be subjective and is reader dependent. Her
                  advice was to seek clarity around how inclusion was defined
                  and to be aware of the team’s own biases, as that is what the
                  tool is trying to solve for.

               <p>
                  When asked about an example of the work she does that best
                  captures the essence of the IT industry, Jess shared an
                  example of a Government customer she has been working with
                  over a long period of time. The customer has multitudes of
                  Microsoft products that were previously unused or
                  under-utilised. Often in her role, interactions are one off,
                  or single days. With this customer, Jess has been back four
                  times now. What has happened over this time is that she has
                  been able to assist them with increasing and building their
                  confidence with using their products. She has seen incredible
                  growth and learning from them as they have moved towards
                  greater technical maturity as an organisation. Jess feels that
                  IT is all about learning. The rate of change and innovation is
                  so high in this industry, you have to keep up or get left
                  behind, "If you don't like learning, you are going to be in
                  the wrong job".
               </p>

               <p>
                  Jess’s advice to those looking to get into the field of IT is
                  to learn as much as you can about a broad range of areas. She
                  feels that unless you know exactly what you want to do, having
                  a broad knowledge will help you in securing your first IT
                  roles. She also expressed that she felt the Bachelor of IT was
                  an excellent way for people to prepare for an IT career given
                  the breadth of content covered.

               <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
               <h3>What does it do?</h3>
               <p>
                  Cloud computing is a leading business methodology involving an
                  advancement of information technology (IT) distribution. It is
                  the amalgamation of resources, including infrastructure,
                  storage, applications and service, with scalable, on-demand
                  access given to stakeholders (Sunyaev 2020). Structurally,
                  cloud-based computing is partitioned into four main areas
                  which maintain different resources. They are equipment,
                  infrastructure, platform and application. The initial section,
                  referring to hardware, includes the physical elements of
                  storage including servers within a data centre and the
                  components, such as cables, energy and cooling systems (Zhang,
                  Chang & Boutaba 2014). There are many parts to the equipment
                  meaning data centres need masses of maintenance. Worldwide,
                  the largest data centres for cloud computing belong to Amazon,
                  Microsoft, Google and IBM. The next level is infrastructure,
                  otherwise known as virtualisation, wherein a simulated
                  computing environment is produced. Virtualisation is a
                  division of computing resources and memory that coalesce,
                  creating virtual environments, stored on servers that share
                  assets. Virtualisation is made possible through programs such
                  as VMware and Xem. Incorporating application frameworks and
                  operating systems is the section above infrastructure,
                  referred to as a platform. The objective of the platform is to
                  facilitate application efficiency. Spearheading these
                  sectional layers is cloud applications. These comprise of
                  software components and local programs (Zhang, Chen & Boutaba
                  2014). These layers may be classified as cloud service models.
                  Cloud service models come under three categories, Software as
                  a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
                  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Despite the three cloud
                  services being different in nature, the collective aim is
                  facilitating consumers to utilise systems and programs
                  effectually. The three deployment models are public, private
                  and hybrid. (Kavis 2014)
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b>
                  <br />
                  The use of the public cloud is growing at treble the rate of
                  private cloud usage as examined by the Flexera 2020 State of
                  the Cloud Report. Cloud service is an exponentially growing
                  field with over a quarter of all tech spending used on SaaS
                  platforms in 2020 and that number projected to rise. Amazon
                  Web Services dominate the market for cloud services, though
                  all providers are showing growth. Most enterprises are
                  utilising a multi-cloud approach. The adoption of cloud
                  services, now considered the norm, and sixty percent of
                  organisations will employ cloud managed services by 2022
                  (Gartner 2019). As cloud services increase, costs regulate,
                  meaning accessibility for more end users. Therefore,
                  advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and accessible
                  scalability result in widespread capabilities and innovations.
                  Data patterns are emerging with the Internet of Things (IoT),
                  meaning the spectrum is widened with DevOps automation using a
                  central platform for testing and the accumulated data has
                  cloud-based storage. With that storage and shared capability,
                  rapid developments are emerging with Edge computing. Similar
                  advancements can be seen in the fields of Blockchain, Virtual
                  Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This progression is
                  due to cloud-based tools enabling developers with abilities to
                  test, collaborate, create and deploy applications.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What can be done now?</b>
                  <br />
                  Cost reduction associated with the acquisition, management and
                  maintenance of IT systems has paved the road for creativity
                  and development of new products and services. Examples of end
                  products users have access to thanks to the cloud are
                  chatbots, social networks, communications, and business
                  management and entertainment platforms.

                  </b>
                  <br />
                  The forecast is continued growth within this sector. As it
                  becomes increasingly available, many developers will have
                  opportunities to develop new technologies and advancements in
                  AI, IoT, AR, VR and other exciting fields. Cloud computing is
                  the backbone for development. We will see an adaption of a
                  serverless model (Flexera 2020), multi-cloud growth, and an
                  increase in Edge technologies.

                  <br />
                  Cloud computing has shown rapid growth with the development of
                  wireless telecommunication (Stergiou & Psannis 2017). Seamless
                  internet access provides a better cloud computing experience.
                  Furthermore, with different web-enabled gadgets such as
                  smartphones and tablets, services and storage are highly
                  accessible.
               </p>

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>
                  With the expansion of cloud services comes many exciting and
                  varied developments within the technology field that will
                  impact daily interactions and functions as a society. Not only
                  does it save companies money, allowing them to use resources
                  to develop new technologies more rapidly, but it also creates
                  a centralised online work environment. Therefore, employees
                  can collaborate fluidly with their teams and other businesses
                  with decentralised physical workspaces. The rise of remote
                  collaboration has brought with it security issues. The main
                  security issues companies’ face with cloud-based, multi-party
                  work models are malware, phishing scams, patches for old
                  operating systems of bring your own devices (BYOD) and
                  configuration drift. To combat this, Alam (2020) suggests
                  adhering to an industry uniform set or parameters offered in
                  an open-source resource to avoid service disruption. Alam
                  (2020) also recommends Symmetric key Encryption for mobile
                  cloud computing (MCC) devices.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b>
                  <br />
                  Due to the structure of cloud computing, the responsibility of
                  security and privacy are distributable amongst providers.
                  Proportionate to the risk, consumers should expect and demand
                  expansion of Security, Transparency and Mutual Audit
                  (Ouedraogo et al. 2015). Aside from privacy and security
                  issues, cloud-based computing will impact the evolution of
                  healthcare, business, marketing, social media and the way we
                  use everyday items with IoT. Cloud computing will reach nearly
                  all aspects of our lives, specifically focussed on economic
                  and technological penetration (Vu, Hartley & Kankanhalli
                  2020).
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b>
                  <br />
                  Groups previously unable to access resources now can do so
                  because of the global reach of cloud computing. Services
                  available online will change the lives of those who earlier
                  found education, healthcare, banking, science, agriculture,
                  work and other essentials inaccessible.

                     >Will this create, replace or make redundant any current
                     jobs or technologies?
                  </b>
                  <br />
                  Job loss due to automation is inevitable with the most
                  vulnerable positions are the entry-level services such as
                  customer service and delivery work.
               </p>

               <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
               <p>
                  <b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b>
                  <br />
                  Cloud computing has already benefited life in many ways. The
                  opportunity for remote work, creating a flexible work routine
                  has meant more time may be spent on personal pursuits
                  resulting in increased job satisfaction and productivity
                  (Felstead & Henseke 2017). Further, CC developments have meant
                  more connectivity, more capability and faster access to the
                  web. Another benefit is the access and consumption of more
                  on-demand digital products such as Netflix and Spotify
                  streaming services.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What will be different for you?</b>
                  <br />
                  New products and services will be accessible to consumers
                  because of pooled resources and business cost reduction. An
                  example of a more accessible product will be the release of
                  the low-cost Tesla 3 electric car. Ecommerce and Mcommerce
                  will be a more immersive and efficient customer experience,
                  thanks to the flourishing of AI technologies that are
                  improving due to cloud access.
               </p>
               <p>

                     >How might this affect members of your family or your
                     friends?</b
                  >
                  <br />
                  Globally, the advancements that have resulted from cloud
                  computing also mean the automation of many jobs and therefore,
                  job loss or sustained unemployment. Jobs for low skilled and
                  young workers, now progressively replaced by bots and programs
                  supported by cloud software, and even higher-level jobs, like
                  accountants and executives, are not immune from job insecurity
                  due to automation (Tang, Ma & Luo 2020). This sustained job
                  loss may lead to an unstable economy. Another effect is
                  consumption trends. Digital natives are hungry for new digital
                  experiences, and as such, demand and usage increase. Platforms
                  like Zoom and Netflix have seen exponential growth during the
                  Covid-19 pandemic and digital platforms will continue to
                  expand. The continued digitisation of mobility, healthcare and
                  real-estate is imminent and this will not only affect job
                  availability and focus but also the way consumers interact
                  with these fields.

               <p>
                  Cybersecurity is the process of protecting and guarding the
                  digital world against cybercrimes (Shaukat et al. 2020). Some
                  of the main categories of cybersecurity include network
                  security, application security, information security, and
                  operational security. Cybersecurity is not only crucial for
                  companies and businesses of great scale, but also for
                  individual users of the web and other digital services. With
                  the passage of time, people are relying significantly on
                  technologies and computers for a myriad of tasks. Mobile
                  banking is becoming increasingly popular, which leaves more
                  people at risk of having their financial data hacked (Oreku &
                  Mtenzi 2016). Information and communication technologies are
                  used in almost every system including financial and emergency
                  services (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016). In the present times,
                  cyberspace has become an essential factor for all fields and
                  areas and the reliance on the internet has led to increased
                  risks of malicious threats (Shaukat et al. 2020).

                     can be done now?</b
                  >
                  <br />
                  Today, there are multiple practices through which the security
                  of a digital product or service can be ensured. Some of the
                  techniques used to prevent cyber attacks include game theory,
                  rate control, heuristics, signature-based intrusion detection,
                  autonomous systems, and end-user security controls (Zeadally
                  et al. 2020). When it comes to the implementation of these
                  practices, awareness plays a crucial role. Without an
                  understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and how to
                  deal with cyberattacks, the consequences are bound to be more
                  damaging. Currently, encryption and identity checks are the
                  most commonly used tactics for cybersecurity. Anti-virus
                  software and firewalls are used to prevent cyberattacks.
                  Businesses have prioritised cybersecurity challenges (Kaja,
                  Shaout & Ma 2019). In larger companies, where the stored
                  information may be critical and require a high level of
                  protection, cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers
                  are hired to identify and secure any surfacing vulnerability
                  within the system. However, as Skopik, Settanni and Fiedler
                  (2016, p. 154) state, 'the Internet threat landscape is
                  fundamentally changing'. The intention and objectives behind
                  cybercrimes have converted and cyberattacks are now carried
                  out in highly complex and targeted approaches that deceive the
                  average security measures (Skopik, Settanni & Fiedler 2016).
                  New technologies are rapidly being produced, with little
                  research and production of the security required to defend
                  these technologies. This leaves undetected gateways for
                  cybercriminals to enter through, leading to destructive
                  consequences for the users of the services and in some cases,
                  to the service owners and providers also (Kaja, Shaout & Ma
                  2019). As within the physical world, the digital world also
                  demands security for its users and the information stored
                  within it. Cybersecurity defence systems must be also using
                  state-of-art technologies to tackle the latest types of
                  cyberattacks.

                  Data and networks are significantly becoming more and more
                  sophisticated. This is an area where artificial intelligence
                  (AI) and machine learning (ML) can work better than humans to
                  provide security in the cyberspace. The use of AI and ML has
                  resulted in breakthroughs in numerous problems and can
                  certainly help in solving current and future cybersecurity
                  issues (Kaja, Shaout & Ma 2019). AI is capable of analysing
                  and inspecting large amounts of data and has proven to be an
                  effective technique for identifying false information
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). It can also 'adapt to the changing
                  nature of Internet traffic' (Zeadally et al. 2020, p. 23827)
                  This is something that would otherwise consume a lot of time.
                  Machine Learning technologies are a field of Artificial
                  Intelligence (Shaukat et al. 2020) and are currently being
                  used in cybersecurity to automate attack detections and
                  enhance their performance over time (Zeadally et al. 2020). ML
                  techniques have a crucial part in battling cyberattacks
                  including intrusion detection system, malware detection,
                  phishing detection, spam detection, and fraud detection
                  (Shaukat et al. 2020). However, some ethical issues and
                  concerns come with the involvement of AI in cybersecurity
                  (Timmers 2019). Also, the limitation that AI relies on
                  learning data that is manually processed and inspected opens
                  the possibility of inaccurate data with regard to
                  cybersecurity (Kim & Park 2020). Another issue is that
                  although ML techniques can efficiently maintain cybersecurity
                  by protecting against attacks, they are also vulnerable to
                  cyberattacks themselves and choosing the most appropriate ML
                  method so far is challenging (Shaukat et al. 2020). Also, for
                  the detection of DoS attacks, real-time detection and decision
                  making is necessary. It is not yet explored how AI can be used
                  for this purpose (Zeadally et al. 2020). Cybersecurity
                  researchers are continuing to explore the use of AI in
                  cybersecurity (Zeadally et al. 2020). It is likely that within
                  the next few years, a significant amount of cybersecurity
                  procedures will be performed with the help of AI and ML.

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b>
                  <br />
                  With the involvement of AI in cybersecurity, the process of
                  detecting a security problem and fixing it will require
                  significantly less time. The approach will focus more on
                  protecting the software or data. This is because prevention is
                  nearly impossible considering the fact that hackers would be
                  using the same technologies for performing cyberattacks
                  (Zeadally et al. 2020). Companies will no longer need to hire
                  ethical hackers as this job would be carried out by AI. As
                  Braganza et al. (2020, p. 1) declare, 'Artificial intelligence
                  (AI) is challenging the foundations of businesses and changing
                  the ways people work globally'.

                     >Will this create, replace or make redundant any current
                     jobs or technologies?</b
                  >
                  <br />
                  Although AI will replace humans in cybersecurity process where
                  mechanical and analytical intelligence is required, its
                  potential is limited when it comes to areas that require
                  intuitive and empathetic intelligence (Braganza et al. 2020).
                  Consequently, the involvement of AI will not affect jobs but
                  rather the nature of the work (Braganza et al. 2020).
                  Professionals would still need to monitor the AI and ML
                  technologies to ensure their efficiency and protection.
                  Although this development will eventually replace some current
                  cybersecurity jobs and technologies, it will bring along new
                  job opportunities such as AI and ML experts who are familiar
                  with handling the AI-driven cybersecurity systems. Some of the
                  current technologies may be used in conjunction with the AI
                  and ML techniques to provide effective security systems.

                  >
                  <br />
                  With real-time detection and protection, the risks of users
                  becoming victims of ransomware will also reduce. Individual
                  home PC users would be safer from cyberattacks with the help
                  of smarter, AI-driven intrusion detection systems. People will
                  not have to do too much to ensure that their information is
                  protected in the cyberspace as the system will be doing it for
                  them. The chances of human error and slips will be
                  significantly reduced. However, users would still need to go
                  through particular procedures to ensure their security systems
                  are working properly. People who use social media or any other
                  app or service that may store any sort of personal information
                  can feel more secure and assured that their data is safe from
                  hackers. A drawback that may be faced is that people might
                  gain a 'false sense of security' and trust the AI system and
                  its decisions without actually knowing how the decision has
                  been reached (Timmers 2019). It is unrealistic to say that one
                  will be 100% secure, or that cybersecurity will be
                  unbreakable. Regardless, as use of the internet increases
                  within society, the ethical security culture would eventually
                  turn into a norm which will assist in tackling cybercrimes
                  (Oreku & Mtenzi 2016).

               <h2>Machine learning</h2>

               <h3>What does it do?</h3>
               <p>
                  In 1956, machine learning pioneer Arthur Samuel succeeded at
                  programming a computer to teach itself to surpass his ability
                  at playing checkers. (McCarthy, n.d.) He coined the term
                  ‘machine learning’ and defined it as a “field of study that
                  gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
                  programmed”. (Ng, 2020).
               </p>

               <p>
                  Computers process large quantities of data accurately and
                  quickly. If tasks can be reduced to their fundamental data and
                  logical arguments, then computers can perform these tasks much
                  better than any human. The outcome of performing these tasks
                  can form another data-point, enabling the computer to ‘learn’
                  to perform the task better next time. A computer can also find
                  relationships in the variables not detectable by humans to
                  ‘learn’ the likely results of a new set of variables. The
                  reality of machine learning though is “…nothing comes out [of
                  a computer] which has not been put in…”(Samuel, 1960).
               </p>

               <p>
                  There are three main types of machine learning algorithms in
                  use (Padala et al., 2019):
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Supervised learning algorithms rely on defined data labels.
                     The machine can look for patterns so that, given a new
                     input, it could predict the likely output. Example: The
                     programmer might input large quantities of labeled images
                     of handwritten lettering, the computer would process all
                     these images and ‘learn’ to read some previously unseen
                     handwriting. Computers do now outperform humans in
                     handwriting analysis. (Esposito, 2017).
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     Unsupervised learning algorithms look for patterns in data
                     where there are no labels. (Ng, 2020, Esposito, 2017) Given
                     a large dataset, the computer may start to identify
                     particular outcomes that correlate with particular inputs.
                     Here the algorithm identifies meaningful limits based on
                     probability factors around clustered data-points. Example:
                     This has been used in looking at the etiology of certain
                     diseases, for example. The algorithm is fed large amounts
                     of health data and may be able to meaningfully group them
                     by particular traits to give clues to factors affecting the
                     disease state. (Ng, 2020)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The third type of machine learning approach is
                     reinforcement learning. Here the algorithm is provided with
                     feedback based on its activity. This model draws on operant
                     conditioning in behavioural psychology. (Dayan, 2002)
                     Example: Arthur Samuel’s checkers playing computer would
                     play countless games against itself, recording when chosen
                     moves resulted in a rewarding outcome to refine its playing
                     strategy.

                  <b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b>
                  <br />
                  Roughly 90 percent of the world’s total data is thought to
                  have been generated in the past 2 years alone. (Bulao, 2020)
                  For computers, this is data like any other, patterns can be
                  found if the computing power allows. The increasing size and
                  variety of data sets available allow for more complex,
                  multi-layer pattern identification known as deep neural
                  networks. With further increasing computing power and
                  different approaches even more can be understood drawing from
                  this data; Quantum computing is that next frontier.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Quantum mechanics is a separate branch of physics dealing with
                  phenomena at an atomic level. (Adams, 2019) Quantum computers
                  can process information much more quickly and handle
                  calculations that overwhelm even the most powerful
                  super-computer currently. Gideon Lichfield (2020) describes
                  the difference between a traditional bit and a quantum bit
                  (qubit) as follows:
               </p>

               <blockquote cite="(Lichfield, 2020)">
                  “If information were color, then a classical bit could be
                  either black or white. A qubit when it’s in superposition
                  could be any color on the spectrum, and could also vary in
                  brightness.” (Lichfield, 2020)
               </blockquote>

               <p>
                  This opens possibilities for breakthroughs in anything that
                  can be represented in data, which is theoretically everything.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>What can be done now?</b><br />
                  Deep neural networks are unlocking understanding previously
                  out of reach with more complex algorithms utilising the huge
                  quantities of data now available and substantial developments
                  in computing power.
               </p>

               <p>
                  While there is significant commercial interest in quantum
                  computing the delicate nature of qubits and rapid decoherence
                  when in superposition is currently proving challenging.
                  Already D-Wave’s quantum computers are being deployed in
                  companies such as Volkswagen to learn to streamline processes,
                  though this is not a pure quantum computer (Kahn, 2020). In
                  2019, Google claimed to solve a problem that would have taken
                  Summit 10 000 years. This, however, is disputed by IBM
                  (Lichfield, 2020). There is a race to develop a more stable
                  and powerful quantum computer, but each player has a different
                  end goal in mind.

                  IBM has promised a 1000-qubit quantum computer by 2023 with a
                  ‘stepping stone’ machine of 127-qubits this year. (Cho, 2020)
                  Google has a plan towards a million-qubit quantum computer in
                  the next 10 years. (Cho, 2020) Some estimate that it would
                  take a 20 million qubit computer to crack 2048-bit encryption
                  and that may be 10-20 years away. (Bushwick, 2019) With each
                  increase in speed and stability, more insight into data is
                  gained and the possibilities grow.

                  Finding ways to stabilise superposition and the incredibly

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>
                  With deep learning and the sheer volume of data generated
                  every day, there is an opportunity to understand the world,
                  how it works, and human behaviour better than ever before.
                  However, with rapidly improving technology comes significant
                  privacy and ethical issues and changes here are not able to
                  keep pace.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Already machine learning facial recognition algorithms are
                  being used for racial profiling in the control of China’s
                  minority Uighur population, for example, (Mozur, 2019) and
                  have obvious international security implications. With the
                  rapid advancement of these technologies and the slow pace of
                  government legislation, potential issues are wide open. Even
                  news, search, and Facebook feed algorithms can dramatically
                  shape people’s world view, limiting exposure to the real
                  breadth of news/media. Most of these algorithms that shape
                  world views are trade secrets, society can only guess at how
                  it is being manipulated.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b><br />
                  Machine Learning is possibly the most significant disruptive
                  technology of this century – coupled with quantum computing,
                  it will likely change the way the how we understand the
                  Universe and humanity’s place in it as well as how people
                  interact in all spheres. These changes, however, are not only
                  from intended advancements. The improvements in quantum
                  machine learning also directly threaten public-key
                  cryptography, underpinning much of the internet and modern
                  commerce. Researchers are looking forward to the quantum-led
                  collapse of 2048-bit encryption, already exploring other
                  approaches to keep data safe. (Bushwick, 2019)
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b><br />
                  If public-key cryptography is cracked without a suitable
                  replacement, the world’s data would be left exposed. It would
                  not just be those who shop online or use social media as even
                  the relatively ‘off-grid’ individuals likely have housing
                  titles, licenses, tax records, medical records. No person in a
                  connected society would be unaffected.

                  Most manufacturing robots are already driven by Machine
                  Learning. Chatbots will reduce customer service roles/tech
                  support roles, couriers are likely to be replaced by
                  autonomous vehicles, market analysts, and even financial
                  advisors. There are elements of most jobs that will be
                  affected. On the other side of this though is an explosion in
                  machine learning roles, implementing these technologies in
                  businesses and homes around the world.

               <p>
                  <b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b><br />
                  Machine learning is pervasive in 2021. Most people are
                  influenced by machine learning algorithms daily or likely even
                  hundreds of times in any given day. Google searches,
                  personalised social media feeds, news feeds, Netflix
                  recommendations, automated vehicles, chatterbots, dynamic
                  pricing, targeted marketing, new medications indicated by an
                  algorithm; the list is long and getting longer by the day.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>What will be different for you?</b><br />
                  Particularly topical in the time of COVID, is whether some of
                  the deep learning models can help to alleviate future global
                  disaster. Epidemiological models can point to potential
                  pandemic outbreak risks (Sun, 2020), models can analyse
                  bushfire behaviour, or better find patterns in cyclone
                  behaviour. Similarly, deep learning models and quantum machine
                  learning could help unlock possibilities for addressing
                  climate change and other questions of global significance. The
                  challenge will be noticing how the individual is affected. It
                  will be unclear what has influenced a world view, a purchasing
                  decision, a new medicine a doctor prescribes yet all of these
                  things will be subject to the influence of machine learning.
                  On a smaller scale, perhaps this century automated vehicles
                  may become mainstream, most homes will interact with a
                  chatterbot regularly, billboards will scan your face to target
                  their advertising, diseases may be cured.

               <h2>Natural language processing & Chatterbots</h2>

               <h3>What does it do?</h3>
               <p>
                  A chatterbot, commonly known as a chatbot, simulates
                  intelligent human responses and emulates conversation (Sha
                  2009). Intelligent processing of human speech is the goal
                  (Deng & Liu 2018). Created with a Python library, it uses
                  machine learning algorithms to produce varying responses. The
                  process of reading and understanding spoken or written
                  language, the translation of one language to another or the
                  automatic answering of questions, through the use of a
                  computer, is called Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP
                  interprets intent, utterance, entity, context and session.
                  Because of the nature and complexity of human language, it is
                  only recently that machine learning (ML) has become
                  experienced enough to converse in a humanoid manner.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</b
                  ><br />
                  The adoption of modern chatbots is increasing exponentially.
                  Due to advancements in ML and NLP, they are smarter and more
                  useful in their responses. NLP is the technology used in voice
                  recognition software for apps like Siri and Alexa (Ahirwar
                  2020). It translates the text to a computer program, a process
                  known as parsing, information is run through complex
                  algorithms to interpret human language. Generative Pre-Trained
                  Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an advanced conversational AI program
                  whose technology will improve existing chatbots. It is the
                  most humanlike of all chatbots, though interestingly, it makes
                  wild suggestions and can lie. Xiaolce is a chatbot that became
                  a Chinese influencer and Mitsuku, while not as new, is a
                  chatbot that won multiple Loebner awards for its engaging
                  conversations.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>What can be done now?</b><br />
                  We use chatbots for many simplistic interactions. Among many
                  other uses, there are chatbots for companionship, dementia
                  patients, medical diagnosis, marketing, news, phycology,
                  research, legal advice, scheduling and most predominantly,
                  customer service. Chatbots have integrated into our daily
                  lives. They can suggest products, help solve queries, make
                  reservations, pay bills and facilitate refunds, frequently
                  asked questions or communication.

                     3 years)?</b
                  ><br />
                  While there is hope that chatbots will integrate seamlessly
                  with society and interactions will be fluid, there are limits
                  to NLP and alternatives like multi-bot AI architecture will
                  need to be explored to improve chatbot accuracy and
                  complexity. As we increase our adoption of chatbot
                  technologies, there is more incidence of data breaches. While
                  the technologies become more widely available, so does the
                  need for increased security around the collected data.
                  Intelligent automation processes will continue to become the
                  norm amongst companies, balancing chatbots and human
                  interaction, therefore, security needs to be proportionate.
                  Increased use of chatbots and data collection is expected,
                  with image recognition, speech recognition, geolocation and
                  automated problem-solving. Customer interactions are forecast
                  to be 85% managed by chatbots shortly (Gartner 2021). Another
                  application will be utilising chatbots to help enmesh the
                  Internet of Things (IoT) into society, with improvements in
                  NLP chatbots will be widely used in many interfaces,
                  particularly home devices (Alexakis et al 2019).

                  ><br />
                  The earliest evaluation of computer NLP was the Turing test,
                  created by Alan Turing in 1950, which tests a program on its
                  human interaction (Hamill 2006). This lead to the Loebner
                  prize, established in 1990, an annual competition in which
                  computer programs are tested for natural language interaction
                  fluidity and will cease once seamless integration is achieved.
                  A multi-bot approach where different chatbots are trained with
                  differing datasets will create an immersive experience.
                  Chatbots are exponentially growing in direct correlation to
                  NLP, AI and machine learning advancements. NLP is rooted in
                  deep learning and complex data sets. Chatbots have become
                  accessible with many platforms providing tailor-built bots,
                  and even code-free bot building, for multiple uses. Two other
                  branches of AI closely related to NLP are automated speech
                  recognition and computer vision. The future will see a
                  combination of these disciplines.
               </p>

               <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
               <p>
                  Interaction with companies is likely to be via the use of a
                  chatbot. Due to the simplistic nature of chatbots currently,
                  they perform low-level customer service or interactions and
                  often are the first port of call when dealing with an enquiry.
                  As the intelligence develops, we will see increasing numbers
                  of bots used on many levels within companies and should expect
                  to have more complex interactions and engagement with the
                  programs. These programs are a bridge between humans and
                  technology and the beginnings of AI relationships (Nimavat
                  2017).
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>What is likely to change?</b><br />
                  These technologies have been somewhat seamless in societal
                  integration, accepted as the norm. While their popularity and
                  usage with companies increase as the technology evolves, we
                  should expect a higher level of interaction, marketing, data
                  ollection and problem-solving. Currently, consumer
                  expectations exceed chatbot capabilities (Nimavat 2017)
                  however, rapid improvement is expected.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b><br />
                  Businesses and consumers will be most affected by chatbots as
                  most customer interaction will be handled by bots, bringing
                  the potential to cut operational costs by 30%.
                  Twenty-four-hour accessibility increases engagement to
                  businesses, enabling rapid answers to queries and emergencies
                  with chatbot ability to answer over 80% of standard questions.
                  Five billion dollars will be invested in chatbots this year,
                  increasing their reach.

                  ><br />
                  Chatbots have already started to replace low-level customer
                  service, marketing and sales staff. As the technologies evolve
                  and become widespread, more of these roles and middle-level
                  roles will begin to be automated and make redundancies. Bots
                  are increasingly replacing human jobs. They helping customers
                  with searching and finding products among several other
                  crucial consumer interactions (Ahirwar 2020). Their presence
                  will only increase in occurrence.

               <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

               <p>
                  <b>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</b><br />
                  Conversation as a service is becoming exponentially popular.
                  Underpinned with NLP technology, there are several tasks
                  chatbots already do to assist us within our daily lives. Some
                  examples are scheduling via Google home, voice command virtual
                  assistants, shopping bots online, automated chatbots for
                  customer service, bookings, paying bills and searching for
                  entertainment. Research shows an increasing desire for
                  technologically advanced homes with smarter interactions
                  utilising natural language and unobtrusive machine integration
                  (Hamill 2006). This trend will continue to expand with the
                  continued adoption of IoT technologies. The widespread use of
                  chatbots has resulted in the mass collection of data metrics
                  and security vulnerabilities of the collected data,
                  unfortunately, the excitement of rapidly adapting these new
                  technologies overshadows the liability (Catruc & Dorin2020).

                  evolving, and an increasing engagement with automated systems
                  is predicted (Gartner 2021). These technologies will guide us
                  to solve problems, find entertainment or seek help from a
                  virtual assistant instead of cumbersome online searches as is
                  the current norm. Integration of these technologies into daily
                  life will optimise and facilitate many daily tasks, creating
                  efficient interactions that save time and money.

                  Over the next decade, predictions tell us, up to four out of
                  ten jobs will be automated (McKinsey Global Institute 2019).
                  These jobs are predominantly entry-level positions that
                  students begin with after school or university. When these
                  jobs are automated, entry to the job market will be difficult,
                  hence, the approach will need to be reviewed, training
                  graduates to be ready for higher-level or dynamic positions.
                  There are instances of chatbots utilised as companions,
                  several exist to reduce isolation, particularly with the older
                  population. However, the ubiquitous replacement of humans with
                  bots may lead to feelings of loneliness when human
                  interactions become robotic. Further, bot interactions may
                  lead to frustration or disappointment because of our
                  expectations. Chatbot abilities are disproportionate to
                  current realities, this is particularly the case amongst baby
                  boomers with millennials generally having realistic
                  expectations.

               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>
                  InRecruit is a software platform that will be used by
                  organisations to improve the overall quality, consistency, and
                  inclusivity of the job descriptions they use to attract new
                  talent. The program will be used by HR teams, hiring managers,
                  talent acquisition, and anyone involved in a company’s hiring
                  process. InRecruit will provide them with an easy to navigate
                  interface, built-in curated job description libraries,
                  critically it will offer recommendations for improvement,
                  identity potential bias, and help organisations track and
                  improve the inclusiveness of their job descriptions.
               </p>
               <p>
                  When looking to hire new staff, rarely will an organisation
                  deliberately set out to exclude entire groups within the
                  population. In fact, in the last five years, there has been an
                  increasing focus globally on diversity and inclusion in the
                  workplace. Market leaders across the IT industry have added
                  Chief Diversity Officers and Managers to their teams including
                  Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Dropbox, Salesforce, and
                  Airbnb (TechRepublic, 2016). Studies by both Forbes and
                  Harvard Business School reinforce the benefits of diversity on
                  both the innovation and financial performance of
                  organisations.
               </p>
               <q
                  >Competition for talent is fierce in today’s global economy,
                  so companies need to have plans in place to recruit, develop,
                  and retain a diverse workforce. (Forbes, 2011)
               </q>
               <p>
                  Understanding how to be inclusive when writing a job
                  description and applying that consistently across an
                  organisation is the challenge faced by most companies.
                  InRecruit will help organisations in their quest to attract
                  diverse talent by simplifying this critical part of the hiring
                  process.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Bridging the gap between recruiters and candidates, InRecruit
                  offers employers a tool to help quickly and easily build
                  inclusive job descriptions, optimised to attract the broadest
                  range of potential candidates to the organisation. With a
                  simple to use interface, recruiters can select from
                  pre-defined fields and the tool populates an inclusive job
                  description, provides suggestions and recommendations on how
                  to improve your job description, and supports approval
                  workflows and automatic job posting. Based on current best
                  practice, whilst removing as much bias as possible from the
                  process, InRecruit reduces the workload of managers, human
                  resources (HR), and talent acquisition teams. Utilising
                  industry standards, organisational preferences and data
                  gathered through the application process the software further
                  refines and learns, to remain relevant over time.
               </p>
               <p>
                  There are lots of tools available in the market that assist
                  with building static job descriptions. What makes InRecruit
                  different is that it has inclusivity built-in, end to end,
                  helping organisations stand out in competitive markets, and
                  enabling them to attract a broader range of candidates. The
                  area of inclusive hiring has had a lot written about it, but
                  in terms of tools to support organisations, there are very few
                  available. When it comes to key features such as analytics,
                  benchmarking, market-specific insights, and on-demand
                  training, there are no applications that can deliver all these
                  features, as well as support inclusive features such as
                  keyword screening, bias analytics, and recommendations.

               <h2>Motivation</h2>
               <p>
                  Why does diversity matter to an organisation? Research
                  published by McKinsey shows that diversity has a direct
                  correlation to financial results.
               </p>
               <q
                  >Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity
                  are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above
                  their respective national industry medians.
                  <br />
                  Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15
                  percent more likely to have financial returns above their
                  respective national industry medians. (McKinsey, 2015)
               </q>
               <p>
                  Forbes found that diversity in an organisation was critical to
                  global success, as well as improving innovation within a
                  company. With financial gains on the line, there is a great
                  incentive for organisations to be genuinely focused on
                  increasing diversity. Hiring diverse talent is not that simple
                  though. One of the big challenges in attracting diverse talent
                  to an organisation is known as self-screening. Self-screening
                  is where a candidate reads a job advertisement and decides
                  that they do not meet the stated criteria, education, or
                  experience requirements and therefore do not apply for the
                  role – never allowing the employer to review the candidate.
                  This act of self-screening is much more prominent in women
                  than it is in men. Research by information technology company
                  Hewlett Packard, revealed women will not apply for an
                  advertised job role unless they believe they meet 100% of the
                  listed criteria, whereas men will apply when they meet around
                  60%. The inclusion of extraneous or over-inflated job
                  requirements is costing employers their candidates.
               </p>
               <p>
                  To address this, organisations must utilise inclusive hiring
                  methods and standards. Job descriptions are the initial window
                  of insight into organisations and an oft lost opportunity to
                  not only find the right candidate for the role but display the
                  business’s culture. Describing the requirements of the
                  position is the point at which companies are unknowingly
                  disconnecting with potential future employees. What is said
                  and how it is worded is critical when competing for talent. In
                  2019 Harvard Business Review researched why women do not apply
                  for roles. Their research identifies narrow job descriptions,
                  non-inclusive language, and culture as critical factors that
                  are deterring women from applying for jobs. A job description
                  can seem like such a simple thing to change, but the impact it
                  can have on hiring responses is significant. As discussed,
                  there has been a lot of research in this area around inclusive
                  hiring, but to date, no simple IT solutions for employers to
                  implement to aid them in doing this better.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Effectively improving diversity within talent pipelines is as
                  simple as tweaking relevant job descriptions. The challenge
                  employers face is knowing which information needs changing,
                  what elements are important, and building those elements into
                  a compelling, engaging, and realistic job narrative. Most
                  managers find themselves time-poor and the recruitment
                  function in many organisations is stretched across multiple
                  roles, offshored, or using a company standard that has existed
                  for many years. The simple act of including a non-essential
                  degree requirement, or specifying that the job requires
                  extensive travel, when in fact it is not an excessive element
                  of the role, are just two examples of negative descriptors
                  organisations add to their job requirements daily, without
                  realising the proportion of candidates they have
                  unintentionally excluded.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The talent pool for female candidates in STEM areas such as IT
                  is already small. A 2019 research report by CUPA HR shows that
                  in the US, only 26% of students undertaking mathematical and
                  computing studies at College are female. When you add factors
                  such as ethnicity, the percentages are tiny. In Australia, the
                  Australian Bureau of Statistics (2020) has almost identical
                  figures for the percentages of women engaged in IT studies.

               <q
                  >Around 445,100 people were studying science, technology,
                  engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields in 2020, with 72% of
                  these students being men. (ABS, 2020)

               <p>
                  When the talent pool is already small, every candidate counts.
                  <br />
                  Building a software platform to enable users to rapidly build
                  highly inclusive job descriptions will immediately increase
                  the number of candidates applying for roles and give
                  organisations greater reach and diversity within the applicant
                  pool.

                     InRecruit will enable organisations to benchmark their job
                     descriptions against the market before they release them.
                     InRecruit will have the following benchmarking
                     capabilities:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Run a comparative check on a completed job description
                        to see similar roles currently in the market.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Run a benchmarking search that will show the estimated
                        salary bracket and expected benefits for a role.

                     <b>Data science and Machine Learning</b>
                     <br />
                     To make InRecruit more durable, it will be built using data
                     science principles, using machine learning to provide users
                     with relevant market information, up to date language and
                     scenarios and relevant recommendations for their job
                     descriptions. These recommendations will draw upon the data
                     gathered from InRecruit’s extensive database. This will
                     enable InRecruit to understand the connections between
                     skills, the value of those skills and their scarcity within
                     a given market. It can then provide recommendations based
                     on this information that enable managers to make better
                     informed decisions when publishing their job
                     advertisements.

                     Chatbots provide an ideal way of supporting users in their
                     interactions with applications and software. InRecruit uses

                        There are several commercial grade chatbot builders. The

                        the platform that are selected. Microsoft offers Bot
                        Service out of the box that enables you to use their

                        Q&A maker.

                        There are similar options available from other providers

                        both platform, as well as cost, as each bot building
                        option has vastly different pricing models from monthly
                        charges to cost per interaction.

                  has been to a high standard and Team Eagle will submit a
                  quality project.

                  Everyone in the team has been contributing and the group have

                  The team have been communicating well and have reflected on
                  the fact that there is a good balance of personalities in the
                  group, which is reflected in our Group Profile and the

                  all being consistent in the way we were using it. In the last
                  few weeks of the assignment, we discussed some ground rules to
                  help us use it more effectively.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Our knowledge of GitHub has also been a challenge. Perhaps we
                  should have spent more time earlier in the project really
                  focusing on how to use the branches, how to keep everything up
                  to date and how to avoid so many conflicts.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Moving into Assignment 3 the group will be able to better
                  manage some of the administration such as the minutes,
                  agendas, chairperson and division of responsibilities. These
                  all came together over the course of the project, but with
                  experience the group will be able to start Assignment 3 with
                  these templates and processes in place.
               </p>
               <h3>What was surprising?</h3>
               <p>
                  The most surprising part of the process was losing a team
                  member who decided to leave the course. This left a large
                  portion of work to be re-done. All the group members were
                  happy to contribute to mitigate the loss. It was an emotional
                  blow to the team members to lose a teammate, all felt the
                  loss.
               </p>
               <h3>What was learnt about groups?</h3>
               <p>
                  Playing to each other’s strengths is key and being able to
                  pivot quickly when needed. Tasks had been allocated early on,
                  and then an additional member joined the team, resulting in a
                  reallocation of tasks. A week from submission, one of the team
                  members pulled out of the course altogether, which meant
                  another rapid pivot, and this time a very conscious choice to
                  play to the strengths of the team to get the remaining tasks
                  completed.
               </p>
               <p>
                  One team member commented that this group works better than
                  the ones at their workplace. The main reason for this has been
                  identified as being that the group communication works
                  effectively.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Working in a group has created a sense of accountability
                  within the team. Where a number of team members have a natural
                  tendency to leave things to the last minute, the
                  accountability provided by the group has changed the way in
                  which they are operating, with no one wanting to let the group
                  down.
               </p>
               <p>
                  One final learning from working in a group is that not
                  everyone is starting from the same base level. The team has
                  very varied levels of experience, both in terms of work, as
                  well as study. This has resulted in having to adapt and
                  account for these differences, whilst learning about each
                  other.

               <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
               <h3>Hannah</h3>
               <p>
                  Hannah enjoyed the collaboration of group work, having never
                  done a university group assignment before. Learning the Teams
                  platform has been useful, and the knowledge will be good for
                  future group work. Seeing the way each member contributed with
                  different offerings was enlightening. For future group
                  assignments Hannah would like to see how each member would
                  choose to contribute and support them with their decisions.
                  The group has shown many strengths and areas to grow during
                  this assignment, Hannah found weaknesses in her own approach
                  that she will be able to monitor for any future work. Team
                  Eagle will be well equipped to complete the last group
                  assignment.
               </p>
               <h3>Fatima</h3>
               <p>
                  As this was Fatima’s first time doing a group project, she
                  wasn’t sure what to expect. Most of her family and friends
                  seemed to have had very bad experiences with group work.
                  Fatima doesn’t know if this was just her luck, but this group
                  has definitely been wonderful. Upon joining the team, she was
                  unsure if she’d have any skills to offer to the group,
                  considering that she had no prior experience in IT. Fatima has
                  gained a little more confidence in her work throughout the
                  group project. She now realises that group work is actually
                  really good when you have a good, understanding, and
                  supportive team. One thing Fatima struggled with was time
                  management. She has experimented with different time
                  management techniques throughout this project and hopes to
                  overcome this issue in the next assignment. There were many
                  new things to learn throughout the process. The group now has
                  a better understanding of which things should be discussed
                  earlier on within the project to better organise their work.
                  Team Eagle will hopefully bring forth excellent work in
                  assignment two and three.
               </p>
               <h3>Nathan</h3>
               <p>
                  Nathan has really enjoyed working in this group. There have
                  been no egos that have gotten in the way and everyone has been
                  willing to help each other out when needed. Communication has
                  been good and constant which has been key with us all remote.
                  We have had some learning to do as well like with using
                  branches with the Github repository. This is something we have
                  all had to learn and but is key when working in teams and
                  contributing a part of the finished product.
               </p>
               <h3>Sarah C</h3>
               <p>
                  Group work is always challenging, and never more so when all
                  team members are working remotely from each other. Sarah
                  joined the team later than everyone else but felt very
                  included and appreciated the way tasks had been allocated
                  based on interests and capabilities. Knowing more about how
                  Teams (the tool) works than the rest of Team Eagle, Sarah
                  should have perhaps offered up some guidance earlier in the
                  assignment to help build a better structure for the site and
                  to help the team more easily keep track of tasks, progress,
                  and issues.
               </p>
               <h3>Sarah B</h3>
               <p>
                  Sarah B has learned a lot from approaching this assignment as
                  a group and watching how other people approach their
                  University assignments. Having a challenging time in her
                  personal life, Sarah struggled to keep up at times but has
                  felt well supported and inspired by the team to persevere.
                  Sarah feels it has been especially useful to learn to
                  collaborate using ‘real-world’ tools like Git and MS Teams and
                  the group was particularly lucky to have some more experienced
                  members who provided guidance here. Some of the learnings with
                  this collaboration software and with team administration more
                  generally will lay a solid foundation for not only Assignment
                  3 but also for future workplace collaborations as they move
                  towards their career goals.
