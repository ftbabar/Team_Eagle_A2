        <h2>IT Work</h2>
        <div class="JessInterview">
          <h3>Jess Dodson</h3>
          <h3>Customer Engineer</h3>
          <h3>Microsoft</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>The job</h4>
          <p>Jess is in her second year of working for Microsoft as a Customer Engineer. Having previously worked as a System Administrator, Jess has expertise in the area of security, which is what she now predominantly specialises in. The main focus of her current role is to support her customers in their use, understanding and application of their Microsoft technology investments. For Jess, this means the majority of her time is spent with customers teaching, sharing, demonstrating and troubleshooting. </p>

          With a background in government and higher education, these tend to be the industries and customers she supports in her work for Microsoft. Within these industries she observed that "IT is seen as a cost sink" and that IT teams are always trying to find ways of doing more with less and operating with very lean teams. Throughout COVID Jess has seen a huge shift in focus in these industries towards security. With the increase in remote working and BYOD trends, identity, authentication and end to end security conversations are her core focus.
          <h4>The activities</h4>
          <p>A typical day for a Customer Engineer depends on whether they are scheduled to be with a customer or not. On a customer facing day, typical activities include triaging email, seeing what has come in overnight, preparing for the customer presentation and checking any demo environments. It isn't unusual for Jess to spend 6 - 10 hours on any given day in Teams voice or video chats with customers - whether that is teaching them something new, doing a demo, running an assessment on existing deployments and infrastructure or helping lead them through building something new in a lab or their own environment. On average, Jess estimates she spends 75% - 80% of her time working directly with customers. She considers herself to be a technical translator. To be successful in her role, she needs to find ways of explaining sometimes complex technical jargon and concepts in simple, easy to consume ways. Her audiences can be anyone from the helpdesk team to the CEO, which requires an aptitude for understanding the audience and delivering a message they can relate to or understand.
          <br>
          On days without customers, Jess focuses her time on technical training and upskilling. Keeping current with the technology she is delivering is critical. She is the face of Microsoft into that customer and is often expected to know a lot about a broad range of subjects. Jess actively sets aside time to make sure she is up to date on product changes, proposed features, as well as understanding what competitors are doing with their products.
          <br>
          Jess regularly contributes to podcasts, interviews, conferences and other speaking engagements. She is a sought after presenter and dedicates additional time to building her content for these sessions.
          <br>
          A typical week for Jess could look something like this:
          <p>
          <img src="Working week.png" alt="Image of calendar" width:"500" height:"200">
          </p>
          Jess faces two main challenges in her role:
          <ol>
            <li>Interaction. Currently Jess is required to deliver all her work remotely. Hosting deeply technical calls with up to 25 people at a time, who are also all working remotely, creates a real challenge in building a rapport, creating personal engagement and driving interaction. For sessions that can span multiple days, this is a real challenge when trying to help customers get the most out of their experience, at the same time as gauging whether the material is pitched at the right level and people are all following what is happening.</li>
            <li>Articulating the why. The second challenge Jess faces is articulating why customers should do what it is she is recommending they do. With a lot of the assessments that Jess does, there are usually recommendations or changes that need to be made, some of which will have a financial impact for an organisation. Jess must find ways of delivering her reports or findings in a compelling manner that enables the customer to take those recommendations forward and sell them to their own internal stakeholders.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          Jess's most valuable technical skills at the moment relate to security. She has skills across Azure IaaS which she leverages on a weekly basis, but it is security tools and Azure Sentinel and conversations about Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) specifically that are in the highest demand.
          <br>
          When taking on the Customer Engineer role, Jess was surprised to find that Executive Presence was a skill she needed on an almost daily basis. Often, she isn't talking to just other technical professionals, but to business owners, investors and C-level executives. This requires her to be compelling and able to demonstrate great presence.
          </p>
          <h4>The interactions</h4>
          <p>When working with customers, the following are the kinds of roles Jess finds herself interacting with:
          <ul>
            <li>Security analysts</li>
            <li>System admins</li>
            <li>Infrastructure engineers</li>
            <li>Network engineers</li>
            <li>CIO</li>
            <li>CISO</li>
            <li>CEO</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>These interactions can vary across information gathering, delivering technical training, providing a demonstration, or presenting the outcome of an assessment. Given the broad range of work that Jess delivers, it is unsurprising that she interacts with such a broad range of roles whilst working with customers.
          <br>
          At Microsoft, Jess has a second set of internal stakeholders that she interacts with each week. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Account Managers - as they "own" the customer relationships and can share key information about the customer itself such as internal structures, who the main stakeholders are, and any current work being done with the customer.</li>
            <li>Cloud Solution Architects - who might also be working with the same customer and delivering POC engagements or other related technical activities.</li>
            <li>Account Technology Strategists - work with customers to support the development of their ongoing digital strategy, including demonstrating new technology as it is released. Jess needs to know what is being shared or shown to the customer, so her presentations are aligned.</li>
            <li>Account Executive - the Account Executive owns the sales strategy for a particular customer and Jess will work with them to understand what is currently planned or can share any insights she gains from the work she does for them.</li>
            <li>Her manager - Jess has a manager who supports a group of Customer Engineers and is there to assist Jess with any challenges she is facing, help her build and execute on her personal development plan and provide coaching to help her growth.</li>
          <br>
          The final, and perhaps most significant group of people that Jess interacts with internally are other Customer Engineers. Through Teams channels and distribution lists she and her fellow Customer Engineers form a strong support network. As a group they are able to share ideas, updates on product changes, but perhaps most importantly, they provide a valuable source of information to each other. No one person could possibly know the depth and breadth of all products developed by Microsoft, but the team of engineers are able to support each other and find the answers quickly to almost any customer challenge. Jess has actively cultivated her network to help her be more able to support her customers when they have questions she doesn't have an immediate answer to.
          <br>
          <h4>In closing</h4>
          When asked about an example of the work she does that best captures the essence of the IT industry, Jess shared an example of a Government customer she has been working with over a long period of time. The customer has multitudes of Microsoft products that were previously unused or under-utilised. Often in her role, interactions are one off, or single days. With this customer, Jess has been back four times now. What has happened over this time is that she has been able to assist them with increasing and building their confidence with using their products. She has seen incredible growth and learning from them as they have moved towards greater technical maturity as an organisation. Jess feels that IT is all about learning. The rate of change and innovation is so high in this industry, you have to keep up or get left behind, "If you don't like learning, you are going to be in the wrong job".
